快乐王子
快乐王子的雕像高高地耸立在城市上空—根高大的石柱上面。他浑身上下镶满了薄薄的
黄金叶片，明亮的蓝宝石做成他的双眼，剑柄上还嵌着一颗硕大的灿灿发光的红色宝石。
世人对他真是称羡不已。“他像风标一样漂亮，”一位想表现自己有艺术品味的市参议
员说了一句，接着又因担心人们将他视为不务实际的人，其实他倒是怪务实的，便补充道：
“只是不如风标那么实用。”
“你为什么不能像快乐王子一样呢？”一位明智的母亲对自己那哭喊着要月亮的小男孩
说，“快乐王子做梦时都从没有想过哭着要东西。”
“世上还有如此快乐的人真让我高兴，”一位沮丧的汉子凝视着这座非凡的雕像喃喃自
语地说着。
“他看上去就像位天使，”孤儿院的孩于们说。他们正从教堂走出来，身上披着鲜红夺
目的斗篷，胸前挂着干净雪白的围嘴儿。
“你们是怎么知道的？”数学教师问道，“你们又没见过天使的模样。”
“啊！可我们见过，是在梦里见到的。”孩子们答道。数学教师皱皱眉头并绷起了面
孔，因为他不赞成孩子们做梦。
有天夜里，一只小燕子从城市上空飞过。他的朋友们早在六个星期前就飞往埃及去了，
可他却留在了后面，因为他太留恋那美丽无比的芦苇小姐。他是在早春时节遇上她的，当时
他正顺河而下去追逐一只黄色的大飞蛾。他为她那纤细的腰身着了迷，便停下身来同她说话。
“我可以爱你吗？”燕子问道，他喜欢一下子就谈到正题上。芦苇向他弯下了腰，于是
他就绕着她飞了一圆又一圈，并用羽翅轻抚着水面，泛起层层银色的涟漪。这是燕子的求爱
方式，他就这样地进行了整个夏天。
“这种恋情实在可笑，”其他燕子吃吃地笑着说，“她既没钱财，又有那么多亲戚。”
的确，河里到处都是芦苇。
等秋天一到，燕子们就飞走了。
大伙走后，他觉得很孤独，并开始讨厌起自己的恋人。“她不会说话，”他说，“况且
我担心她是个荡妇，你看她老是跟风调情。”这可不假，一旦起风，芦苇便行起最优雅的屈
膝礼。“我承认她是个居家过日子的人，”燕子继续说，“可我喜爱旅行，而我的妻子，当
然也应该喜爱旅行才对。”
“你愿意跟我走吗？”他最后问道。然而芦苇却摇摇头，她太舍不得自己的家了。
“原来你跟我是闹着玩的，”他吼叫着，“我要去金字塔了，再见吧！”说完他就飞走
了。
他飞了整整一天，夜晚时才来到这座城市。“我去哪儿过夜呢？”他说，“我希望城里
已做好了准备。”
这时，他看见了高大圆柱上的雕像。
“我就在那儿过夜，”他高声说，“这是个好地方，充满了新鲜空气。”于是，他就在
快乐王子两脚之间落了窝。
“我有黄金做的卧室，”他朝四周看看后轻声地对自己说，随之准备入睡了。但就在他
把头放在羽翅下面的时候，一颗大大的水珠落在他的身上。“真是不可思议！”他叫了起
来，“天上没有一丝云彩，繁星清晰又明亮，却偏偏下起了雨。北欧的天气真是可怕。芦苇
是喜欢雨水的，可那只是她自私罢了。”
紧接着又落下来一滴。
“一座雕像连雨都遮挡不住，还有什么用处？”他说，“我得去找一个好烟囱做窝。”
他决定飞离此处。
可是还没等他张开羽翼，第三滴水又掉了下来，他抬头望去，看见了——啊！他看见了
什么呢？
快乐王子的双眼充满了泪水，泪珠顺着他金黄的脸颊淌了下来。王子的脸在月光下美丽
无比，小燕子顿生怜悯之心。
“你是谁？”他问对方。
“我是快乐王子。”
“那么你为什么哭呢？”燕子又问，“你把我的身上都打湿了。”
“以前在我有颗人心而活着的时候，”雕像开口说道，“我并不知道眼泪是什么东西，
因为那时我住在逍遥自在的王宫里，那是个哀愁无法进去的地方。白天人们伴着我在花园里
玩，晚上我在大厅里领头跳舞。沿着花园有一堵高高的围墙，可我从没想到去围墙那边有什
么东西，我身边的一切太美好了。我的臣仆们都叫我快乐王子，的确，如果欢愉就是快乐的
话，那我真是快乐无比。我就这么活着，也这么死去。而眼下我死了，他们把我这么高高地
立在这儿，使我能看见自己城市中所有的丑恶和贫苦，尽管我的心是铅做的，可我还是忍不
住要哭。”
“啊！难道他不是铁石心肠的金像？”燕子对自己说。他很讲礼貌，不愿大声议论别人
的私事。
“远处，”雕像用低缓而悦耳的声音继续说，“远处的一条小街上住着一户穷人。一扇
窗户开着，透过窗户我能看见一个女人坐在桌旁。她那瘦削的脸上布满了倦意，一双粗糙发
红的手上到处是针眼，因为她是一个裁缝。她正在给缎子衣服绣上西番莲花，这是皇后最喜
爱的宫女准备在下一次宫廷舞会上穿的。在房间角落里的一张床上躺着她生病的孩子。孩子
在发烧，嚷着要吃桔子。他的妈妈除给他喂几口河水外什么也没有，因此孩子老是哭个不
停。燕子，燕子，小燕子，你愿意把我剑柄上的红宝石取下来送给她吗？我的双脚被固定在
这基座上，不能动弹。”
“伙伴们在埃及等我，”燕子说，“他们正在尼罗河上飞来飞去，同朵朵大莲花说着话
儿，不久就要到伟大法老的墓穴里去过夜。法老本人就睡在自己彩色的棺材中。他的身体被
裹在黄色的亚麻布里，还填满了防腐的香料。他的脖子上系着一圈浅绿色翡翠项链，他的双
手像是枯萎的树叶。”
“燕子，燕子，小燕子，”王子又说，“你不肯陪我过一夜，做我的信使吗？那个孩子
太饥渴了，他的母亲伤心极了。”
“我觉得自己不喜欢小孩，”燕子回答说，“去年夏天，我到过一条河边，有两个顽皮
的孩于，是磨坊主的儿子，他们老是扔石头打我。当然，他们永远也别想打中我，我们燕子
飞得多快呀，再说，我出身于一个以快捷出了名的家庭；可不管怎么说，这是不礼貌的行
为。”
可是快乐王子的满脸愁容叫小燕子的心里很不好受。“这儿太冷了，”他说，“不过我
愿意陪你过上一夜，并做你的信使。”
“谢谢你，小燕子，”王子说。
于是燕子从王子的宝剑上取下那颗硕大的红宝石，用嘴衔着，越过城里一座连一座的屋
顶，朝远方飞去。
他飞过大教堂的塔顶，看见了上面白色大理石雕刻的天使像。他飞过王宫，听见了跳舞
的歌曲声。一位美丽的姑娘同她的心上人走上了天台。“多么奇妙的星星啊，”他对她说，
“多么美妙的爱情啊3”
“我希望我的衣服能按时做好，赶得上盛大舞会，”她回答说，“我已要求绣上西番莲
花，只是那些女裁缝们都太得了。”
他飞过了河流，看见了高挂在船桅上的无数灯笼。他飞过了犹太区，看见犹太老人们在
彼此讨价还价地做生意，还把钱币放在铜制的天平上称重量。最后他来到了那个穷人的屋
舍，朝里面望去。发烧的孩子在床上辗转反侧，母亲已经睡熟了，因为她太疲倦了。他跳进
屋里，将硕大的红宝石放在那女人顶针旁的桌子上。随后他又轻轻地绕者床飞了一圈，用羽
翅扇着孩子的前额。“我觉得好凉爽，”孩子说，“我一定是好起来了。”说完就沉沉地进
入了甜蜜的梦乡。
然后，燕子回到快乐王子的身边，告诉他自己做过的一切。“你说怪不怪，”他接着
说，“虽然天气很冷，可我现在觉得好暖和。”
“那是因为你做了一件好事，”王子说。于是小燕子开始想王子的话，不过没多久便睡
着了。对他来说，一思考问题就老想困觉。
黎明时分他飞下河去洗了个澡。“真是不可思议的现象，”一位鸟禽学教授从桥上走过
时开口说道，“冬天竟会有燕子！”于是他给当地的报社关于此事写去了一封长信。每个人
都引用他信中的话，尽管信中的很多词语是人们理解不了的。
“今晚我要到埃及去，”燕子说，一想到远方，他就精神百倍。他走访了城里所有的公
共纪念物，还在教堂的顶端上坐了好一阵子。每到一处，麻雀们就吱吱喳喳地相互说，“多
么难得的贵客啊！”所以他玩得很开心。
月亮升起的时候他飞回到快乐王子的身边。“你在埃及有什么事要办吗？”他高声问
道，“我就要动身了。”
“燕子，燕子，小燕子，”王子说，“你愿意陪我再过一夜吗？”
“伙伴们在埃及等我呀，”燕子回答说，“明天我的朋友们要飞往第二瀑布，那儿的河
马在纸莎草丛中过夜。古埃及的门农神安坐在巨大的花岗岩宝座上，他整夜守望着星星，每
当星星闪烁的时候，他就发出欢快的叫声，随后便沉默不语。中午时，黄色的狮群下山来到
河边饮水，他们的眼睛像绿色的宝石，咆哮起来比瀑布的怒吼还要响亮。”“燕子，燕子，
小燕子，”王子说，“远处在城市的那一头，我看见住在阁楼中的一个年轻男子。他在一张
铺满纸张的书桌上埋头用功，旁边的玻璃杯中放着一束干枯的紫罗兰。他有一头棕色的卷
发，嘴唇红得像石榴，他还有一双睡意朦胧的大眼睛。他正力争为剧院经理写出一个剧本，
但是他已经给冻得写不下去了。壁炉里没有柴火，饥饿又弄得他头昏眼花。”
“我愿意陪你再过一夜，”燕子说，他的确有颗善良的心。“我是不是再送他一块红宝
石？”
“唉！我现在没有红宝石了。”王子说，“所剩的只有我的双眼。它们由稀有的蓝宝石
做成，是一干多年前从印度出产的。取出一颗给他送去。他会将它卖给珠宝商，好买回食物
和木柴，完成他写的剧本。”
“亲爱的王子，”燕子说，“我不能这样做，”说完就哭了起来。
“燕子，燕子，小燕子，”王子说，“就照我说的话去做吧。”
因此燕子取下了王子的一只眼睛，朝学生住的阁楼飞去了。由于屋顶上有一个洞，燕子
很容易进去。就这样燕子穿过洞来到屋里。年轻人双手捂着脸，没有听见燕子翅膀的扇动
声，等他抬起头时，正看见那颗美丽的蓝宝石放在干枯的紫罗兰上面。
“我开始受人欣赏了，”他叫道，“这准是某个极其钦佩我的人送来的。现在我可以完
成我的剧本了。”他脸上露出了幸福的笑容。
第二天燕子飞到下面的海港，他坐在一震大船的桅杆上，望着水手们用绳索把大箱子拖
出船舱。随着他们嘿哟！嘿哟！”的声声号子，一个个大箱子给拖了上来。“我要去埃及
了！”燕子略道，但是没有人理会他。等月亮升起后，他又飞回到快乐王子的身边。
“我是来向你道别的，”他叫着说。
“燕子，燕子，小燕子，”王子说，“你不愿再陪我过一夜吗？”
“冬天到了，”燕子回答说，“寒冷的雪就要来了。而在埃及，太阳挂在葱绿的棕搁树
上，暖和极了，还有躺在泥塘中的鳄鱼懒洋洋地环顾着四周。我的朋友们正在巴尔贝克古城
的神庙里建筑巢穴，那些粉红和银白色的鸽子们一边望着他们干活，一边相互倾诉着情话。
亲爱的王子，我不得不离你而去了，只是我永远也不会忘记你的，明年春天我要给你带回两
颗美丽的宝石，弥补你因送给别人而失掉的那西颗，红宝石会比一朵红玫瑰还红，蓝宝石也
比大海更蓝。”
“在下面的广场上，”快乐王子说，“站着一个卖火柴的小女孩。她的火柴都掉在阴沟
里了，它们都不能用了。如果她不带钱回家，她的父亲会打她的，她正在哭着呢。她既没穿
鞋，也没有穿袜子，头上什么也没戴。请把我的另一只眼睛取下来，给她送去，这样她父亲
就不会揍她了。”
“我愿意陪你再过一夜，”燕子说，“但我不能取下你的眼睛，否则你就变成个瞎子
了。”
“燕子，燕子，小燕子，”王子说，“就照我说的话去做吧。”
子是他又取下了王子的另一只眼珠，带着它朝下飞去。他一下子落在小女孩的面前，把
宝石悄悄地放在她的手掌心上。“一块多么美丽的玻璃呀！”小女孩高声叫着，她笑着朝家
里跑去。
这时，燕子回到王子身旁。“你现在瞎了，”燕子说，“我要永远陪着你。”
“不，小燕子，”可怜的王子说，“你得到埃及去。”
“我要一直陪着你，”燕子说着就睡在了王子的脚下。
第二天他整日坐在王子的肩头上，给他讲自己在异国他乡的所见所闻和种种经历。他还
给王子讲那些红色的朱鹭，它们排成长长的一行站在尼罗河的岸边，用它们的尖嘴去捕捉金
鱼；还讲到司芬克斯，它的岁数跟世界一样长久，住在沙漠中，通晓世间的一切；他讲纽那
些商人，跟着自己的驼队缓缓而行，手中摸着狼冶做的念珠；他讲到月亮山的国王，他皮肤
黑得像乌木，崇拜一块巨大的水晶；他讲到那条睡在棕祸树上的绿色大莽蛇，要20个僧侣
用蜜糖做的糕点来喂它；他又讲到那些小矮人，他们乘坐扁平的大树叶在湖泊中往来横渡，
还老与蝴蝶发生战争。”
“亲爱的小燕子，”王子说，“你为我讲了好多稀奇的事情，可是更稀奇的还要算那些
男男女女们所遭受的苦难。没有什么比苦难更不可思议的了。小燕子，你就到我城市的上空
去飞一圈吧，告诉我你在上面都看见了些什么。”，
于是燕子飞过了城市上空，看见富人们在自己漂亮的洋楼里寻欢作乐，而乞丐们却坐在
大门口忍饥挨饿。他飞进阴暗的小巷，看见饥饿的孩子们露出苍白的小脸没精打采地望着昏
暗的街道，就在一座桥的桥洞里面两个孩子相互搂抱着想使彼此温暖一些。“我们好饿
呀！”他俩说。“你们不准躺在这儿，”看守高声叹道，两个孩子又跚蹒着朝雨中走去。
随后他飞了回来，把所见的一切告诉给了王子。
“我浑身贴满了上好的黄金片，”王子说，“你把它们一片片地取下来，给我的穷人们
送去。活着的人都相信黄金会使他们幸福的。”
燕子将足赤的黄金叶子一片一片地啄了下来，直到快乐王子变得灰暗无光。他又把这些
纯金叶片一一送给了穷人，孩子们的脸上泛起了红晕，他们在大街上欢欣无比地玩着游戏。
“我们现在有面包了！”孩子们喊叫着。
随后下起了雪，白雪过后又迎来了严寒。街道看上去白花花的，像是银子做成的，又明
亮又耀眼；长长的冰柱如同水晶做的宝剑垂悬在屋檐下。人人都穿上了皮衣，小孩子们也戴
上了红帽子去户外溜冰。
可怜的小燕子觉得越来越冷了，但是他却不愿离开王子，他太爱这位王子了。他只好趁
面包师不注意的时候，从面包店门口弄点面包屑充饥，并扑扇着翅膀为自己取暖。
然而最后他也知道自己快要死去了。他剩下的力气只够再飞到王子的肩上一回。“再见
了，亲爱的王子！”他喃喃地说，“你愿重让我亲吻你的手吗？”
“我真高兴你终于要飞往埃及去了，小燕子，”王子说，“你在这儿呆得太长了。不过
你得亲我的嘴唇，因为我爱你。”
“我要去的地方不是埃及，”燕子说，“我要去死亡之家。死亡是长眠的兄弟，不是
吗？”
接着他亲吻了快乐王子的嘴唇，然后就跌落在王子的脚下，死去了。
就在此刻，雕像体内伸出一声奇特的爆裂声，好像有什么东西破碎了。其实是王子的那
颗铅做的心已裂成了两半。这的确是一个可怕的寒冷冬日，
第二天一早，市长由市参议员们陪同着散步来到下面的广场。他们走过圆柱的时候，市
长抬头看了一眼雕像，“我的天啊！快乐王子怎么如此难看！”他说。
“真是难看极了！”市参议员们异口同声地叫道，他们平时总跟市长一个腔调。说完大
家纷纷走上前去细看个明白。
“他剑柄上的红宝石已经掉了，蓝宝石眼珠也不见了，他也不再是黄金的了，”市长
说，“实际上，他比一个要饭的乞丐强不了多少！”
“的确比要饭的强不了多少，”市参议员们附和着说。
“还有在他的脚下躺着一只死鸟！”市长继续说，“我们真应该发布一个声明，禁止鸟
类死在这个地方。”于是市书记员把这个建议记录了下来。
后来他们就把快乐王子的雕像给推倒了。“既然他已不再美丽，那么也就不再有用
了，”大学的美术教授说。
接着他们把雕像放在炉里熔化了，市长还召集了一次市级的会议来决定如何处理这些金
属，当然，我们必须再铸一个雕像。”他说，“那应该就是我的雕像。”
“我的雕像，”每一位市参议员都争着说，他们还吵了起来。我最后听到人们说起他们
时，他们的争吵仍未结束。
“多么稀奇古怪的事！”铸像厂的工头说，“这颗破裂的铅心在炉子里熔化不了。我们
只好把它扔掉。”他们便把它扔到了垃圾堆里，死去的那只燕子也躺在那儿。
“把城市里最珍贵的两件东西给我拿来，”上帝对他的一位天使说。于是天使就把铅心
和死鸟给上帝带了回来。
“你的选择对极了，”上帝说，“因为在我这天堂的花园里，小鸟可以永远地放声歌
唱，而在我那黄金的城堡中，快乐王子可以尽情地赞美我。”

The Happy Prince

www.xiabook.com
the happy prince
high above the city, on a tall column, stood the statue of the
happy prince.  he was gilded all over with thin leaves of fine
gold, for eyes he had two bright sapphires, and a large red ruby
glowed on his sword-hilt.
he was very much admired indeed.  "he is as beautiful as a
weathercock," remarked one of the town councillors who wished to
gain a reputation for having artistic tastes; "only not quite so
useful," he added, fearing lest people should think him
unpractical, which he really was not.
"why cant you be like the happy prince?" asked a sensible mother
of her little boy who was crying for the moon.  "the happy prince
never dreams of crying for anything."
"i am glad there is some one in the world who is quite happy,"
muttered a disappointed man as he gazed at the wonderful statue.
"he looks just like an angel," said the charity children as they
came out of the cathedral in their bright scarlet cloaks and their
clean white pinafores.
"how do you know?" said the mathematical master, "you have never
seen one."
"ah! but we have, in our dreams," answered the children; and the
mathematical master frowned and looked very severe, for he did not
approve of children dreaming.
one night there flew over the city a little swallow.  his friends
had gone away to egypt six weeks before, but he had stayed behind,
for he was in love with the most beautiful reed.  he had met her
early in the spring as he was flying down the river after a big
yellow moth, and had been so attracted by her slender waist that he
had stopped to talk to her.
"shall i love you?" said the swallow, who liked to come to the
point at once, and the reed made him a low bow.  so he flew round
and round her, touching the water with his wings, and making silver
ripples.  this was his courtship, and it lasted all through the
summer.
"it is a ridiculous attachment," twittered the other swallows; "she
has no money, and far too many relations"; and indeed the river was
quite full of reeds.  then, when the autumn came they all flew
away.
after they had gone he felt lonely, and began to tire of his lady-
love.  "she has no conversation," he said, "and i am afraid that
she is a coquette, for she is always flirting with the wind."  and
certainly, whenever the wind blew, the reed made the most graceful
curtseys.  "i admit that she is domestic," he continued, "but i
love travelling, and my wife, consequently, should love travelling
also."
"will you come away with me?" he said finally to her; but the reed
shook her head, she was so attached to her home.
"you have been trifling with me," he cried.  "i am off to the
pyramids.  good-bye!" and he flew away.
all day long he flew, and at night-time he arrived at the city.
"where shall i put up?" he said; "i hope the town has made
preparations."
then he saw the statue on the tall column.
"i will put up there," he cried; "it is a fine position, with
plenty of fresh air."  so he alighted just between the feet of the
happy prince.
"i have a golden bedroom," he said softly to himself as he looked
round, and he prepared to go to sleep; but just as he was putting
his head under his wing a large drop of water fell on him.  "what a
curious thing!" he cried; "there is not a single cloud in the sky,
the stars are quite clear and bright, and yet it is raining.  the
climate in the north of europe is really dreadful.  the reed used
to like the rain, but that was merely her selfishness."
then another drop fell.
"what is the use of a statue if it cannot keep the rain off?" he
said; "i must look for a good chimney-pot," and he determined to
fly away.
but before he had opened his wings, a third drop fell, and he
looked up, and saw - ah! what did he see?
the eyes of the happy prince were filled with tears, and tears were
running down his golden cheeks.  his face was so beautiful in the
moonlight that the little swallow was filled with pity.
"who are you?" he said.
"i am the happy prince."
"why are you weeping then?" asked the swallow; "you have quite
drenched me."
"when i was alive and had a human heart," answered the statue, "i
did not know what tears were, for i lived in the palace of sans-
souci, where sorrow is not allowed to enter.  in the daytime i
played with my companions in the garden, and in the evening i led
the dance in the great hall.  round the garden ran a very lofty
wall, but i never cared to ask what lay beyond it, everything about
me was so beautiful.  my courtiers called me the happy prince, and
happy indeed i was, if pleasure be happiness.  so i lived, and so i
died.  and now that i am dead they have set me up here so high that
i can see all the ugliness and all the misery of my city, and
though my heart is made of lead yet i cannot chose but weep."
"what! is he not solid gold?" said the swallow to himself.  he was
too polite to make any personal remarks out loud.
"far away," continued the statue in a low musical voice, "far away
in a little street there is a poor house.  one of the windows is
open, and through it i can see a woman seated at a table.  her face
is thin and worn, and she has coarse, red hands, all pricked by the
needle, for she is a seamstress.  she is embroidering passion-
flowers on a satin gown for the loveliest of the queens maids-of-
honour to wear at the next court-ball.  in a bed in the corner of
the room her little boy is lying ill.  he has a fever, and is
asking for oranges.  his mother has nothing to give him but river
water, so he is crying.  swallow, swallow, little swallow, will you
not bring her the ruby out of my sword-hilt?  my feet are fastened
to this pedestal and i cannot move."
"i am waited for in egypt," said the swallow.  "my friends are
flying up and down the nile, and talking to the large lotus-
flowers.  soon they will go to sleep in the tomb of the great king.
the king is there himself in his painted coffin.  he is wrapped in
yellow linen, and embalmed with spices.  round his neck is a chain
of pale green jade, and his hands are like withered leaves."
"swallow, swallow, little swallow," said the prince, "will you not
stay with me for one night, and be my messenger?  the boy is so
thirsty, and the mother so sad."
"i dont think i like boys," answered the swallow.  "last summer,
when i was staying on the river, there were two rude boys, the
millers sons, who were always throwing stones at me.  they never
hit me, of course; we swallows fly far too well for that, and
besides, i come of a family famous for its agility; but still, it
was a mark of disrespect."
but the happy prince looked so sad that the little swallow was
sorry.  "it is very cold here," he said; "but i will stay with you
for one night, and be your messenger."
"thank you, little swallow," said the prince.
so the swallow picked out the great ruby from the princes sword,
and flew away with it in his beak over the roofs of the town.
he passed by the cathedral tower, where the white marble angels
were sculptured.  he passed by the palace and heard the sound of
dancing.  a beautiful girl came out on the balcony with her lover.
"how wonderful the stars are," he said to her, "and how wonderful
is the power of love!"
"i hope my dress will be ready in time for the state-ball," she
answered; "i have ordered passion-flowers to be embroidered on it;
but the seamstresses are so lazy."
he passed over the river, and saw the lanterns hanging to the masts
of the ships.  he passed over the ghetto, and saw the old jews
bargaining with each other, and weighing out money in copper
scales.  at last he came to the poor house and looked in.  the boy
was tossing feverishly on his bed, and the mother had fallen
asleep, she was so tired.  in he hopped, and laid the great ruby on
the table beside the womans thimble.  then he flew gently round
the bed, fanning the boys forehead with his wings.  "how cool i
feel," said the boy, "i must be getting better"; and he sank into a
delicious slumber.
then the swallow flew back to the happy prince, and told him what
he had done.  "it is curious," he remarked, "but i feel quite warm
now, although it is so cold."
"that is because you have done a good action," said the prince.
and the little swallow began to think, and then he fell asleep.
thinking always made him sleepy.
when day broke he flew down to the river and had a bath.  "what a
remarkable phenomenon," said the professor of ornithology as he was
passing over the bridge.  "a swallow in winter!"  and he wrote a
long letter about it to the local newspaper.  every one quoted it,
it was full of so many words that they could not understand.
"to-night i go to egypt," said the swallow, and he was in high
spirits at the prospect.  he visited all the public monuments, and
sat a long time on top of the church steeple.  wherever he went the
sparrows chirruped, and said to each other, "what a distinguished
stranger!" so he enjoyed himself very much.
when the moon rose he flew back to the happy prince.  "have you any
commissions for egypt?" he cried; "i am just starting."
"swallow, swallow, little swallow," said the prince, "will you not
stay with me one night longer?"
"i am waited for in egypt," answered the swallow.  "to-morrow my
friends will fly up to the second cataract.  the river-horse
couches there among the bulrushes, and on a great granite throne
sits the god memnon.  all night long he watches the stars, and when
the morning star shines he utters one cry of joy, and then he is
silent.  at noon the yellow lions come down to the waters edge to
drink.  they have eyes like green beryls, and their roar is louder
than the roar of the cataract.
"swallow, swallow, little swallow," said the prince, "far away
across the city i see a young man in a garret.  he is leaning over
a desk covered with papers, and in a tumbler by his side there is a
bunch of withered violets.  his hair is brown and crisp, and his
lips are red as a pomegranate, and he has large and dreamy eyes.
he is trying to finish a play for the director of the theatre, but
he is too cold to write any more.  there is no fire in the grate,
and hunger has made him faint."
"i will wait with you one night longer," said the swallow, who
really had a good heart.  "shall i take him another ruby?"
"alas!  i have no ruby now," said the prince; "my eyes are all that
i have left.  they are made of rare sapphires, which were brought
out of india a thousand years ago.  pluck out one of them and take
it to him.  he will sell it to the jeweller, and buy food and
firewood, and finish his play."
"dear prince," said the swallow, "i cannot do that"; and he began
to weep.
"swallow, swallow, little swallow," said the prince, "do as i
command you."
so the swallow plucked out the princes eye, and flew away to the
students garret.  it was easy enough to get in, as there was a
hole in the roof.  through this he darted, and came into the room.
the young man had his head buried in his hands, so he did not hear
the flutter of the birds wings, and when he looked up he found the
beautiful sapphire lying on the withered violets.
"i am beginning to be appreciated," he cried; "this is from some
great admirer.  now i can finish my play," and he looked quite
happy.
the next day the swallow flew down to the harbour.  he sat on the
mast of a large vessel and watched the sailors hauling big chests
out of the hold with ropes.  "heave a-hoy!" they shouted as each
chest came up.  "i am going to egypt"! cried the swallow, but
nobody minded, and when the moon rose he flew back to the happy
prince.
"i am come to bid you good-bye," he cried.
"swallow, swallow, little swallow," said the prince, "will you not
stay with me one night longer?"
"it is winter," answered the swallow, "and the chill snow will soon
be here.  in egypt the sun is warm on the green palm-trees, and the
crocodiles lie in the mud and look lazily about them.  my
companions are building a nest in the temple of baalbec, and the
pink and white doves are watching them, and cooing to each other.
dear prince, i must leave you, but i will never forget you, and
next spring i will bring you back two beautiful jewels in place of
those you have given away.  the ruby shall be redder than a red
rose, and the sapphire shall be as blue as the great sea."
"in the square below," said the happy prince, "there stands a
little match-girl.  she has let her matches fall in the gutter, and
they are all spoiled.  her father will beat her if she does not
bring home some money, and she is crying.  she has no shoes or
stockings, and her little head is bare.  pluck out my other eye,
and give it to her, and her father will not beat her."
"i will stay with you one night longer," said the swallow, "but i
cannot pluck out your eye.  you would be quite blind then."
"swallow, swallow, little swallow," said the prince, "do as i
command you."
so he plucked out the princes other eye, and darted down with it.
he swooped past the match-girl, and slipped the jewel into the palm
of her hand.  "what a lovely bit of glass," cried the little girl;
and she ran home, laughing.
then the swallow came back to the prince.  "you are blind now," he
said, "so i will stay with you always."
"no, little swallow," said the poor prince, "you must go away to
egypt."
"i will stay with you always," said the swallow, and he slept at
the princes feet.
all the next day he sat on the princes shoulder, and told him
stories of what he had seen in strange lands.  he told him of the
red ibises, who stand in long rows on the banks of the nile, and
catch gold-fish in their beaks; of the sphinx, who is as old as the
world itself, and lives in the desert, and knows everything; of the
merchants, who walk slowly by the side of their camels, and carry
amber beads in their hands; of the king of the mountains of the
moon, who is as black as ebony, and worships a large crystal; of
the great green snake that sleeps in a palm-tree, and has twenty
priests to feed it with honey-cakes; and of the pygmies who sail
over a big lake on large flat leaves, and are always at war with
the butterflies.
"dear little swallow," said the prince, "you tell me of marvellous
things, but more marvellous than anything is the suffering of men
and of women.  there is no mystery so great as misery.  fly over my
city, little swallow, and tell me what you see there."
so the swallow flew over the great city, and saw the rich making
merry in their beautiful houses, while the beggars were sitting at
the gates.  he flew into dark lanes, and saw the white faces of
starving children looking out listlessly at the black streets.
under the archway of a bridge two little boys were lying in one
anothers arms to try and keep themselves warm.  "how hungry we
are!" they said.  "you must not lie here," shouted the watchman,
and they wandered out into the rain.
then he flew back and told the prince what he had seen.
"i am covered with fine gold," said the prince, "you must take it
off, leaf by leaf, and give it to my poor; the living always think
that gold can make them happy."
leaf after leaf of the fine gold the swallow picked off, till the
happy prince looked quite dull and grey.  leaf after leaf of the
fine gold he brought to the poor, and the childrens faces grew
rosier, and they laughed and played games in the street.  "we have
bread now!" they cried.
then the snow came, and after the snow came the frost.  the streets
looked as if they were made of silver, they were so bright and
glistening; long icicles like crystal daggers hung down from the
eaves of the houses, everybody went about in furs, and the little
boys wore scarlet caps and skated on the ice.
the poor little swallow grew colder and colder, but he would not
leave the prince, he loved him too well.  he picked up crumbs
outside the bakers door when the baker was not looking and tried
to keep himself warm by flapping his wings.
but at last he knew that he was going to die.  he had just strength
to fly up to the princes shoulder once more.  "good-bye, dear
prince!" he murmured, "will you let me kiss your hand?"
"i am glad that you are going to egypt at last, little swallow,"
said the prince, "you have stayed too long here; but you must kiss
me on the lips, for i love you."
"it is not to egypt that i am going," said the swallow.  "i am
going to the house of death.  death is the brother of sleep, is he
not?"
and he kissed the happy prince on the lips, and fell down dead at
his feet.
at that moment a curious crack sounded inside the statue, as if
something had broken.  the fact is that the leaden heart had
snapped right in two.  it certainly was a dreadfully hard frost.
early the next morning the mayor was walking in the square below in
company with the town councillors.  as they passed the column he
looked up at the statue:  "dear me! how shabby the happy prince
looks!" he said.
"how shabby indeed!" cried the town councillors, who always agreed
with the mayor; and they went up to look at it.
"the ruby has fallen out of his sword, his eyes are gone, and he is
golden no longer," said the mayor in fact, "he is litttle beter
than a beggar!"
"little better than a beggar," said the town councillors.
"and here is actually a dead bird at his feet!" continued the
mayor.  "we must really issue a proclamation that birds are not to
be allowed to die here."  and the town clerk made a note of the
suggestion.
so they pulled down the statue of the happy prince.  "as he is no
longer beautiful he is no longer useful," said the art professor at
the university.
then they melted the statue in a furnace, and the mayor held a
meeting of the corporation to decide what was to be done with the
metal.  "we must have another statue, of course," he said, "and it
shall be a statue of myself."
"of myself," said each of the town councillors, and they
quarrelled.  when i last heard of them they were quarrelling still.
"what a strange thing!" said the overseer of the workmen at the
foundry.  "this broken lead heart will not melt in the furnace.  we
must throw it away."  so they threw it on a dust-heap where the
dead swallow was also lying.
"bring me the two most precious things in the city," said god to
one of his angels; and the angel brought him the leaden heart and
the dead bird.
"you have rightly chosen," said god, "for in my garden of paradise
this little bird shall sing for evermore, and in my city of gold
the happy prince shall praise me."

夜莺与玫瑰

小.说。t!xt-天堂
夜莺与玫瑰
“她说过只要我送给她一些红玫瑰，她就愿意与我跳舞，”一位年轻的学生大声说道，
“可是在我的花园里，连一朵红玫瑰也没有。”
这番话给在圣栎树上自己巢中的夜莺听见了，她从绿叶丛中探出头来，四处张望着。
“我的花园里哪儿都找不到红玫瑰，”他哭着说，一双美丽的眼睛充满了泪水。“唉，
难道幸福竟依赖于这么细小的东西！我读过智者们写的所有文章，知识的一切奥秘也都装在
我的头脑中，然而就因缺少一朵红玫瑰我却要过痛苦的生活。”
“这儿总算有一位真正的恋人了，”夜莺对自己说，“虽然我不认识他，但我会每夜每
夜地为他歌唱，我还会每夜每夜地把他的故事讲给星星听。现在我总算看见他了，他的头发
黑得像风信子花，他的嘴唇就像他想要的玫瑰那样红；但是感情的折磨使他脸色苍白如象
牙，忧伤的印迹也爬上了他的眉梢。”
“王子明天晚上要开舞会，”年轻学生喃喃自语地说，“我所爱的人将要前往。假如我
送她一朵红玫瑰，她就会同我跳舞到天明；假如我送她一朵红玫瑰，我就能搂着她的腰，她
也会把头靠在我的肩上，她的手将捏在我的手心里。可是我的花园里却没有红玫瑰，我只能
孤零零地坐在那边，看着她从身旁经过。她不会注意到我，我的心会碎的。”
“这的确是位真正的恋人，”夜莺说，“我所为之歌唱的正是他遭受的痛苦，我所为之
快乐的东西，对他却是痛苦。爱情真是一件奇妙无比的事情，它比绿宝石更珍贵，比猫眼石
更稀奇。用珍珠和石榴都换不来，是市场上买不到的，是从商人那儿购不来的，更无法用黄
金来称出它的重量。”
“乐师们会坐在他们的廊厅中，”年轻的学生说，“弹奏起他们的弦乐器。我心爱的人
将在竖琴和小提琴的音乐声中翩翩起舞。她跳得那么轻松欢快，连脚跟都不蹭地板似的。那
些身着华丽服装的臣仆们将她围在中间。然而她就是不会同我跳舞，因为我没有红色的玫瑰
献给她。”于是他扑倒在草地上，双手捂着脸放声痛哭起来。
“他为什么哭呢？”一条绿色的小蜥蜴高高地翘起尾巴从他身旁跑过时，这样问道。
“是啊，倒底为什么？”一只蝴蝶说，她正追着一缕阳光在跳舞。
“是啊，倒底为什么？”一朵雏菊用低缓的声音对自已的邻居轻声说道。
“他为一朵红玫瑰而哭泣。”夜莺告诉大家。
“为了一朵红玫瑰？”他们叫了起来。“真是好笑！”小蜥蜴说，他是个爱嘲讽别人的
人，忍不住笑了起来。
可只有夜莺了解学生忧伤的原因，她默默无声地坐在橡树上，想象着爱情的神秘莫测。
突然她伸开自己棕色的翅膀，朝空中飞去。她像个影子似的飞过了小树林，又像个影子
似的飞越了花园。
在一块草地的中央长着一棵美丽的玫瑰树，她看见那棵树后就朝它飞过去，落在一根小
枝上。
“给我一朵红玫瑰，”她高声喊道，“我会为你唱我最甜美的歌。”
可是树儿摇了摇头。
“我的玫瑰是白色的，”它回答说，“白得就像大海的浪花沫，白得超过山顶上的积
雪。但你可以去找我那长在古日晷器旁的兄弟，或许他能满足你的需要。”
于是夜莺就朝那棵生长在古日晷器旁的玫瑰树飞去了。
“给我-朵红玫瑰，”她大声说，“我会为你唱我最甜美的歌。”
可是树儿摇了摇头。
“我的玫瑰是黄色的，”它回答说，“黄得就像坐在琥珀宝座上的美人鱼的头发，黄得
超过拿着镰刀的割草人来之前在草地上盛开的水仙花。但你可以去找我那长在学生窗下的兄
弟，或许他能满足你的需要。”
于是夜寓就朝那棵生长在学生窗下的玫瑰树飞去了。
“给我一朵红玫瑰，”她大声说，“我会为你唱我最甜美的歌。”
可是树儿摇了摇头。
“我的玫瑰是红色的，”它回答说，“红得就像鸽子的脚，红得超过在海洋洞穴中飘动
的珊瑚大扇。但是冬天已经冻僵了我的血管，霜雪已经摧残了我的花蕾，风暴已经吹折了我
的枝叶，今年我不会再有玫瑰花了。”
“我只要一朵玫瑰花，”夜莺大声叫道，“只要一朵红玫瑰！难道就没有办法让我得到
它吗？”
“有一个办法，”树回答说，“但就是太可怕了，我都不敢对你说。”
“告诉我，”夜莺说，“我不怕。”
“如果你想要一朵红玫瑰，”树儿说，“你就必须借助月光用音乐来造出它，并且要用
你胸中的鲜血来染红它。你一定要用你的胸膛顶住我的一根刺来唱歌。你要为我唱上整整一
夜，那根刺一定要穿透你的胸膛，你的鲜血一定要流进我的血管，并变成我的血。”
“拿死亡来换一朵玫瑰，这代价实在很高，”夜莺大声叫道，“生命对每一个人都是非
常宝贵的。坐在绿树上看太阳驾驶着她的金马车，看月亮开着她的珍珠马车，是一件愉快的
事情。山楂散发出香味，躲藏在山谷中的风铃草以及盛开在山头的石南花也是香的。然而爱
情胜过生命，再说鸟的心怎么比得过人的心呢？”
于是她便张开自己棕色的翅膀朝天空中飞去了。她像影子似的飞过花园，又像影子似的
穿越了小树林。
年轻的学生仍躺在草地上，跟她离开时的情景一样，他那双美丽的眼睛还挂着泪水。
“快乐起来吧，”夜莺大声说，“快乐起来吧，你就要得到你的红玫瑰了。我要在月光
下把它用音乐造成，献出我胸膛中的鲜血把它染红。我要求你报答我的只有一件事，就是你
要做一个真正的恋人，因为尽管哲学很聪明，然而爱情比她更聪明，尽管权力很伟大，可是
爱情比他更伟大。火焰映红了爱情的翅膀，使他的身躯像火焰一样火红。他的嘴唇像蜜一样
甜；他的气息跟乳香一样芬芳。”
学生从草地上抬头仰望着，并侧耳倾听，但是他不懂夜莺在对他讲什么，因为他只知道
那些写在书本上的东西。
可是橡树心里是明白的，他感到很难受，因为他十分喜爱这只在自己树枝上做巢的小夜
莺。
“给我唱最后一支歌吧，”他轻声说，“你这一走我会觉得很孤独的。”
于是夜莺给橡树唱起了歌，她的声音就像是银罐子里沸腾的水声。
等她的歌声一停，学生便从草地上站起来，从他的口袋中拿出一个笔记本和一支铅笔。
“她的样子真好看，”他对自己说，说着就穿过小树林走开了一一“这是不能否认的；
但是她有情感吗？我想她恐怕没有。事实上，她像大多数艺术家-样，只讲究形式，没有任
何诚意。她不会为别人做出牺牲的。她只想着音乐，人人都知道艺术是自私的。不过我不得
不承认她的歌声申也有些美丽的调子。只可惜它们没有一点意义，也没有任何实际的好
处。”他走进屋子，躺在自己那张简陋的小床上，想起他那心爱的人儿，不一会儿就进入了
梦乡。
等到月亮挂上了天际的时候，夜莺就朝玫瑰树飞去，用自己的胸膛顶住花刺。她用胸膛
顶着刺整整唱了一夜，就连冰凉如水晶的明月也俯下身来倾听。整整一夜她唱个不停，刺在
她的胸口上越刺越深，她身上的鲜血也快要流光了。
她开始唱起少男少女的心中萌发的爱情。在玫瑰树最高的枝头上开放出一朵异常的玫
瑰，歌儿唱了一首又一首，花瓣也一片片地开放了。起初，花儿是乳白色的，就像悬在河上
的雾霾--白得就如同早晨的足履，白得就像黎明的翅膀。在最高枝头上盛开的那朵玫瑰花，
如同一朵在银镜中，在水池里照出的玫瑰花影。
然而这时树大声叫夜莺把刺顶得更紧一些。“顶紧些，小夜莺，”树大叫着，“不然玫
瑰还没有完成天就要亮了。”
于是夜莺把刺顶得更紧了，她的歌声也越来越响亮了，因为她歌唱着一对成年男女心中
诞生的激情。
一层淡淡的红晕爬上了玫瑰花瓣，就跟新郎亲吻新娘时脸上泛起的红晕一样。但是花刺
还没有达到夜莺的心脏，所以玫瑰的心还是白色的，因为只有夜莺心里的血才能染红玫瑰的
花心。
这时树又大声叫夜莺顶得更紧些，“再紧些，小夜莺，”树儿高声喊着，“不然，玫瑰
还没完成天就要亮了。”
于是夜莺就把玫瑰刺顶得更紧了，刺着了自己的心脏，一阵剧烈的痛楚袭遍了她的全
身。痛得越来越厉害，歌声也越来越激烈，因为她歌唱着由死亡完成的爱情，歌唱着在坟墓
中也不朽的爱情。
最后这朵非凡的玫瑰变成了深红色，就像东方天际的红霞，花瓣的外环是深红色的，花
心更红得好似一块红宝石。
不过夜莺的歌声却越来越弱了，她的一双小翅膀开始扑打起来，一层雾膜爬上了她的双
目。她的歌声变得更弱了，她觉得喉咙给什么东西堵住了。
这时她唱出了最后一曲。明月听着歌声，竟然忘记了黎明，只顾在天空中徘徊。红玫瑰
听到歌声，更是欣喜若狂，张开了所有的花瓣去迎接凉凉的晨风。回声把歌声带回自己山中
的紫色洞穴中，把酣睡的牧童从梦乡中唤醒。歌声飘越过河中的芦苇，芦苇又把声音传给了
大海。
“快看，快看！”树叫了起来，“玫瑰已长好了。”可是夜莺没有回答，因为她已经躺
在长长的草丛中死去了，心口上还扎着那根刺。
中午时分，学生打开窗户朝外看去。
“啊，多好的运气呀！”他大声嚷道，“这儿竟有一朵红玫瑰！这样的玫瑰我一生也不
曾见过。它太美了，我敢说它有一个好长的拉丁名字。”他俯下身去把它摘了下来。
随即他戴上帽子，拿起玫瑰，朝教授的家跑去。
教授的女儿正坐在门口，在纺车上纺着蓝色的丝线，她的小狗躺在她的脚旁。
“你说过只要我送你一朵红玫遗，你就会同我跳舞，”学生高声说道，“这是全世界最
红的一朵玫瑰。你今晚就把它戴在你的胸口上，我们一起跳舞的时候，它会告诉你我是多么
的爱你。”
然而少女却皱起眉头。
“我担心它与我的衣服不相配，”她回答说，“再说，宫廷大臣的侄儿已经送给我一些
珍贵的珠宝，人人都知道珠宝比花更加值钱。”
“噢，我要说，你是个忘恩负义的人，”学生愤怒地说。一下把玫瑰扔到了大街上，玫
瑰落入阴沟里，一辆马车从它身上碾了过去。
“忘恩负义！”少女说，“我告诉你吧，你太无礼；再说，你是什么？只是个学生。
啊，我敢说你不会像宫廷大臣侄儿那样，鞋上钉有银扣子。”说完她就从椅子上站起来朝屋
里走去。
“爱情是多么愚昧啊！”学生一边走一边说，“它不及逻辑一半管用，因为它什么都证
明不了，而它总是告诉人们一些不会发生的事，并且还让人相信一些不真实的事。说实话，
它一点也不实用，在那个年代，一切都要讲实际。我要回到哲学中去，去学形而上学的东
西。”
于是他便回到自己的屋子里，拿出满是尘土的大书，读了起来。
the nightingale and the rose
"she said that she would dance with me if i brought her red roses,"
cried the young student; "but in all my garden there is no red
rose."
from her nest in the holm-oak tree the nightingale heard him, and
she looked out through the leaves, and wondered.
"no red rose in all my garden!" he cried, and his beautiful eyes
filled with tears.  "ah, on what little things does happiness
depend!  i have read all that the wise men have written, and all
the secrets of philosophy are mine, yet for want of a red rose is
my life made wretched."
"here at last is a true lover," said the nightingale.  "night after
night have i sung of him, though i knew him not:  night after night
have i told his story to the stars, and now i see him.  his hair is
dark as the hyacinth-blossom, and his lips are red as the rose of
his desire; but passion has made his face like pale ivory, and
sorrow has set her seal upon his brow."
"the prince gives a ball to-morrow night," murmured the young
student, "and my love will be of the company.  if i bring her a red
rose she will dance with me till dawn.  if i bring her a red rose,
i shall hold her in my arms, and she will lean her head upon my
shoulder, and her hand will be clasped in mine.  but there is no
red rose in my garden, so i shall sit lonely, and she will pass me
by.  she will have no heed of me, and my heart will break."
"here indeed is the true lover," said the nightingale.  "what i
sing of, he suffers - what is joy to me, to him is pain.  surely
love is a wonderful thing.  it is more precious than emeralds, and
dearer than fine opals.  pearls and pomegranates cannot buy it, nor
is it set forth in the marketplace.  it may not be purchased of the
merchants, nor can it be weighed out in the balance for gold."
"the musicians will sit in their gallery," said the young student,
"and play upon their stringed instruments, and my love will dance
to the sound of the harp and the violin.  she will dance so lightly
that her feet will not touch the floor, and the courtiers in their
gay dresses will throng round her.  but with me she will not dance,
for i have no red rose to give her"; and he flung himself down on
the grass, and buried his face in his hands, and wept.
"why is he weeping?" asked a little green lizard, as he ran past
him with his tail in the air.
"why, indeed?" said a butterfly, who was fluttering about after a
sunbeam.
"why, indeed?" whispered a daisy to his neighbour, in a soft, low
voice.
"he is weeping for a red rose," said the nightingale.
"for a red rose?" they cried; "how very ridiculous!" and the little
lizard, who was something of a cynic, laughed outright.
but the nightingale understood the secret of the students sorrow,
and she sat silent in the oak-tree, and thought about the mystery
of love.
suddenly she spread her brown wings for flight, and soared into the
air.  she passed through the grove like a shadow, and like a shadow
she sailed across the garden.
in the centre of the grass-plot was standing a beautiful rose-tree,
and when she saw it she flew over to it, and lit upon a spray.
"give me a red rose," she cried, "and i will sing you my sweetest
song."
but the tree shook its head.
"my roses are white," it answered; "as white as the foam of the
sea, and whiter than the snow upon the mountain.  but go to my
brother who grows round the old sun-dial, and perhaps he will give
you what you want."
so the nightingale flew over to the rose-tree that was growing
round the old sun-dial.
"give me a red rose," she cried, "and i will sing you my sweetest
song."
but the tree shook its head.
"my roses are yellow," it answered; "as yellow as the hair of the
mermaiden who sits upon an amber throne, and yellower than the
daffodil that blooms in the meadow before the mower comes with his
scythe.  but go to my brother who grows beneath the students
window, and perhaps he will give you what you want."
so the nightingale flew over to the rose-tree that was growing
beneath the students window.
"give me a red rose," she cried, "and i will sing you my sweetest
song."
but the tree shook its head.
"my roses are red," it answered, "as red as the feet of the dove,
and redder than the great fans of coral that wave and wave in the
ocean-cavern.  but the winter has chilled my veins, and the frost
has nipped my buds, and the storm has broken my branches, and i
shall have no roses at all this year."
"one red rose is all i want," cried the nightingale, "only one red
rose!  is there no way by which i can get it?"
"there is away," answered the tree; "but it is so terrible that i
dare not tell it to you."
"tell it to me," said the nightingale, "i am not afraid."
"if you want a red rose," said the tree, "you must build it out of
music by moonlight, and stain it with your own hearts-blood.  you
must sing to me with your breast against a thorn.  all night long
you must sing to me, and the thorn must pierce your heart, and your
life-blood must flow into my veins, and become mine."
"death is a great price to pay for a red rose," cried the
nightingale, "and life is very dear to all.  it is pleasant to sit
in the green wood, and to watch the sun in his chariot of gold, and
the moon in her chariot of pearl.  sweet is the scent of the
hawthorn, and sweet are the bluebells that hide in the valley, and
the heather that blows on the hill.  yet love is better than life,
and what is the heart of a bird compared to the heart of a man?"
so she spread her brown wings for flight, and soared into the air.
she swept over the garden like a shadow, and like a shadow she
sailed through the grove.
the young student was still lying on the grass, where she had left
him, and the tears were not yet dry in his beautiful eyes.
"be happy," cried the nightingale, "be happy; you shall have your
red rose.  i will build it out of music by moonlight, and stain it
with my own hearts-blood.  all that i ask of you in return is that
you will be a true lover, for love is wiser than philosophy, though
she is wise, and mightier than power, though he is mighty.  flame-
coloured are his wings, and coloured like flame is his body.  his
lips are sweet as honey, and his breath is like frankincense."
the student looked up from the grass, and listened, but he could
not understand what the nightingale was saying to him, for he only
knew the things that are written down in books.
but the oak-tree understood, and felt sad, for he was very fond of
the little nightingale who had built her nest in his branches.
"sing me one last song," he whispered; "i shall feel very lonely
when you are gone."
so the nightingale sang to the oak-tree, and her voice was like
water bubbling from a silver jar.
when she had finished her song the student got up, and pulled a
note-book and a lead-pencil out of his pocket.
"she has form," he said to himself, as he walked away through the
grove - "that cannot be denied to her; but has she got feeling?  i
am afraid not.  in fact, she is like most artists; she is all
style, without any sincerity.  she would not sacrifice herself for
others.  she thinks merely of music, and everybody knows that the
arts are selfish.  still, it must be admitted that she has some
beautiful notes in her voice.  what a pity it is that they do not
mean anything, or do any practical good."  and he went into his
room, and lay down on his little pallet-bed, and began to think of
his love; and, after a time, he fell asleep.
and when the moon shone in the heavens the nightingale flew to the
rose-tree, and set her breast against the thorn.  all night long
she sang with her breast against the thorn, and the cold crystal
moon leaned down and listened.  all night long she sang, and the
thorn went deeper and deeper into her breast, and her life-blood
ebbed away from her.
she sang first of the birth of love in the heart of a boy and a
girl.  and on the top-most spray of the rose-tree there blossomed a
marvellous rose, petal following petal, as song followed song.
pale was it, at first, as the mist that hangs over the river - pale
as the feet of the morning, and silver as the wings of the dawn.
as the shadow of a rose in a mirror of silver, as the shadow of a
rose in a water-pool, so was the rose that blossomed on the topmost
spray of the tree.
but the tree cried to the nightingale to press closer against the
thorn.  "press closer, little nightingale," cried the tree, "or the
day will come before the rose is finished."
so the nightingale pressed closer against the thorn, and louder and
louder grew her song, for she sang of the birth of passion in the
soul of a man and a maid.
and a delicate flush of pink came into the leaves of the rose, like
the flush in the face of the bridegroom when he kisses the lips of
the bride.  but the thorn had not yet reached her heart, so the
roses heart remained white, for only a nightingales hearts-blood
can crimson the heart of a rose.
and the tree cried to the nightingale to press closer against the
thorn.  "press closer, little nightingale," cried the tree, "or the
day will come before the rose is finished."
so the nightingale pressed closer against the thorn, and the thorn
touched her heart, and a fierce pang of pain shot through her.
bitter, bitter was the pain, and wilder and wilder grew her song,
for she sang of the love that is perfected by death, of the love
that dies not in the tomb.
and the marvellous rose became crimson, like the rose of the
eastern sky.  crimson was the girdle of petals, and crimson as a
ruby was the heart.
but the nightingales voice grew fainter, and her little wings
began to beat, and a film came over her eyes.  fainter and fainter
grew her song, and she felt something choking her in her throat.
then she gave one last burst of music.  the white moon heard it,
and she forgot the dawn, and lingered on in the sky.  the red rose
heard it, and it trembled all over with ecstasy, and opened its
petals to the cold morning air.  echo bore it to her purple cavern
in the hills, and woke the sleeping shepherds from their dreams.
it floated through the reeds of the river, and they carried its
message to the sea.
"look, look!" cried the tree, "the rose is finished now"; but the
nightingale made no answer, for she was lying dead in the long
grass, with the thorn in her heart.
and at noon the student opened his window and looked out.
"why, what a wonderful piece of luck!" he cried; "here is a red
rose!  i have never seen any rose like it in all my life.  it is so
beautiful that i am sure it has a long latin name"; and he leaned
down and plucked it.
then he put on his hat, and ran up to the professors house with
the rose in his hand.
the daughter of the professor was sitting in the doorway winding
blue silk on a reel, and her little dog was lying at her feet.
"you said that you would dance with me if i brought you a red
rose," cried the student.  "here is the reddest rose in all the
world.  you will wear it to-night next your heart, and as we dance
together it will tell you how i love you."
but the girl frowned.
"i am afraid it will not go with my dress," she answered; "and,
besides, the chamberlains nephew has sent me some real jewels, and
everybody knows that jewels cost far more than flowers."
"well, upon my word, you are very ungrateful," said the student
angrily; and he threw the rose into the street, where it fell into
the gutter, and a cart-wheel went over it.
"ungrateful!" said the girl.  "i tell you what, you are very rude;
and, after all, who are you?  only a student.  why, i dont believe
you have even got silver buckles to your shoes as the chamberlains
nephew has"; and she got up from her chair and went into the house.
"what i a silly thing love is," said the student as he walked away.
"it is not half as useful as logic, for it does not prove anything,
and it is always telling one of things that are not going to
happen, and making one believe things that are not true.  in fact,
it is quite unpractical, and, as in this age to be practical is
everything, i shall go back to philosophy and study metaphysics."
so he returned to his room and pulled out a great dusty book, and
began to read.

自私的巨人

自私的巨人
每天下午，孩子们放学后总喜欢到巨人的花园里去玩耍。
这是一个很可爱的大花园，长满了绿茸茸的青草，美丽的鲜花随处可见，多得像天上的
星星。草地上还长着十二棵桃树，一到春天就开放出粉扑扑的团团花朵，秋天里则结下累累
果实。栖息在树枝上鸟儿唱着欢乐的曲子，每当这时，嬉戏中的孩子们会停下来侧耳玲听鸟
儿的鸣唱，并相互高声喊着，“我们多么快乐啊1”
一天，巨人回来了。原来他到自己的妖怪朋友科尼西家串门去了，在妖怪家里一住就是
七年。七年的时间里他把要讲的话都讲完了，便决定回自己的城堡。进了家门，他一眼就看
见在花园中戏耍的孩子们。
“你们在这儿于什么？”他粗声粗气地吼叫起来，孩子们都跑掉了。
“我的花园就是我自己的花园，”巨人说，“谁都清楚，我不准外人来这里玩。”于
是，他沿着花园筑起一堵高高的围墙，还挂出一块告示：闲人莫入违者重罚
他的确是一个非常自私的巨人。
从此可怜的孩子们没有了玩耍的地方，他们只得来到马路上，但是街道上满是尘土和硬
硬的石块，让他们扫兴极了。放学后他们仍常常在高耸的围墙外徘徊，谈论着墙内花园中的
美丽景色。“在里面我们多么快乐啊，”他们彼此诉说着。
春天又来了，整个乡村到处开故着小花，处处有小鸟在欢唱。然而只有自私的巨人的花
园却依旧是一片寒冬景象。由于看不见孩子们，小鸟便无心唱歌，树儿也忘了开花。有一朵
花儿从草中探出头来，看见那块告示后，它对孩子们的遭遇深感同情，于是又把头缩回去，
继续睡觉了。只有雪和霜对此乐不可支。“春天已忘记了这座花园，”他们叫喊着，“这样
我们可以一年四季住在这儿了。”雪用她那巨大的白色斗篷把草地蓝得严严实实，霜也让所
有的树木披上假装，随后他们还逸来北风和他们同住。北风应邀而至，穿—身毛皮大衣，他
对着花园呼啸了整整一天，把烟囱管帽也给吹掉了。“这是个令人开心的地方，”他说，
“我们还得把冰雹叫来。”于是，冰雹来了。每天三个钟头他不停地敲打着城堡的房顶，房
上的石板瓦被砸得七零八落，然后又围着花园一圈接一圈地猛跑起来。他浑身上下灰蒙蒙
的，呼出阵阵袭人的寒气。
“我真弄不懂春天为什么迟迟不来，”巨人坐在窗前望着外面冰天雪地的花园说，“我
盼望天气发生变化。”
然而春天再也没有出现，夏天也不见踪影。秋天把金色的硕果送给了千家万户的花园，
却什么也没给巨人的花园。“他太自私了，”秋天说。就这样，巨人的花园里是终年的寒
冬，只有北风、冰雹，还有霜和雪在园中的林间上窜下跳。
一日清晨，巨人睁着双眼躺在床上，这时耳边传来阵阵美妙的音乐。音乐悦耳动听，他
想一定是国王的乐师路经此地。原来窗外唱歌的不过是一只小红雀，只因巨人好长时间没听
到鸟儿在花园中歌唱，此刻感到它妙不可言。这时，巨人头顶上的冰雹已不再狂舞，北风也
停止了呼啸，缕缕芳香透过敞开的窗廓扑面而来。“我相信春天终于来到了，”巨人说着，
从床上跳起来，朝窗外望去。
他看见了什么呢？
他看见了一幕动人的景象：孩子们爬过墙上的小洞已进了花园，正坐在树枝上，每棵树
上都坐着一个孩子。迎来了孩子的树木欣喜若狂，井用鲜花把自己打扮一新，还挥动手臂轻
轻抚摸孩子们的头。鸟儿们在树梢翩翩起舞，兴奋地欢唱着，花朵也纷纷从草地里伸出头来
露着笑脸。这的确是一幅动人的画面。满园春色中只有一个角落仍笼罩在严冬之中，那是花
园中最远的一个角落，一个小男孩正孤零零地站在那儿，因为他个头太小爬不上树，只能围
着树转来转去，哭泣着不知所措。那棵可怜的树仍被霜雪裹得严严实实的，北风也对它肆意
地咆哮着。“快爬上来呀，小孩子1”树儿说，并尽可能地垂下枝条，可是小孩还是太矮小了。
此情此景深深地感化了巨人的心。“我真是太自私了！”他说，“现在我明白为什么春
天不肯到我这儿来了。我要把那可怜的孩子抱上树，然后再把围墙都推倒，让我的花园永远
成为孩子们的游戏场所。”他真为自己过去的所做所为感到羞愧。
巨人轻轻地走下楼，悄悄地打开前门，走到花园里。但是孩子们一看巨人，都吓得逃走
了，花园再次回到了冬天里。唯有那个小男孩没有跑，因为他的眼里充满了泪水，没有看见
走过来的巨人。巨人悄悄来到小孩的身后，双手轻轻托起孩子放在树枝上。树儿立即怒放出
朵朵鲜花，鸟儿们也飞回枝头放声欢唱，小男孩伸出双臂搂着巨人的脖子，亲吻巨人的脸。
其他孩子看见巨人不再那么凶恶，都纷纷跑了回来，春天也跟着孩子们来了。“孩子们，这
是你们的花园了，”巨人说。接着他提起一把大斧头，把围墙统统给砍倒了。中午12点，
人们去赶集的时候，欣喜地看见巨人和孩子们一起在他们所见到的最美丽的花园中游戏玩耍。
他们玩了整整一天，夜幕降临后，孩子们向巨人道晚安。
“可你们的那个小伙伴在哪儿呢？”巨人问，“就是我抱到树上的男孩。”巨人最爱那
个男孩，因为男孩吻过他。
“我们不知道啊，”孩子们回答说，“他已经走了。”
巨人又说：“你们一定要告诉他，叫他明天来这里。”但是孩子们告诉巨人他们不知道
小男孩家住何处，而且从前没见过他，巨人听后心里很不是个滋味。
每天下午，孩子们一放学就来找巨人一起玩。可是巨人喜爱的那个小男孩再也没有来
过。巨人对每一个小孩都非常友善，然而他更想念那个小男孩，还常常提起他。“我多么想
见到他啊：”巨人常常感叹道。
许多年过去了，巨人变得年迈而体弱。他已无力再与孩子们一起嬉戏，只能坐在一把巨
大的扶手椅上，一边观看孩于们玩游戏，一边欣赏着自己的花园。“我有好多美丽的鲜
花，”他说，“但孩子们才是最美的花朵。”
冬天的一个早晨，巨人起床穿衣时朝窗外望了望。现在他已不讨厌冬天了，因为他心里
明白这只不过是让春天打个吨，让花儿们歇口气罢了。
突然，他惊讶地揉揉眼，定睛看了又看。眼前的景色真是美妙无比：在花园尽头的角落
里，有一棵树上开满了逗人喜爱的白花，满树的枝条金光闪闪，枝头上垂挂着银色的果实，
树的下边就站着巨人特别喜爱的那个小男孩。
巨人激动地跑下楼，出门朝花园奔去。他急匆匆地跑过草地，奔向孩子。来到孩子面
前，他脸红脖子粗地愤愤说道，“谁敢把你弄成这样？”只见孩子的一双小手掌心上留有两
个钉痕，他的一双小脚上也有两个钉痕。
“谁敢把你弄成这样？”巨人吼道，“告诉我，我去取我的长剑把他杀死。”
“不要！”孩子回答说，“这些都是爱的烙印啊。”
“你是谁？”巨人说着，心中油然生出一种奇特的敬畏之情。他一下子跪在小男孩的面
前。
小男孩面带笑容地看着巨人说道：“你让我在你的花园中玩过一次。今天我要带你去我
的花园，那就是天堂。”
那天下午孩子们跑进花园的时候，他们看见巨人躺在那棵树下，已经死了，满身都盖着
白花。
the selfish giant
every afternoon, as they were coming from school, the children used
to go and play in the giants garden.
it was a large lovely garden, with soft green grass.  here and
there over the grass stood beautiful flowers like stars, and there
were twelve peach-trees that in the spring-time broke out into
delicate blossoms of pink and pearl, and in the autumn bore rich
fruit.  the birds sat on the trees and sang so sweetly that the
children used to stop their games in order to listen to them.  "how
happy we are here!" they cried to each other.
one day the giant came back.  he had been to visit his friend the
cornish ogre, and had stayed with him for seven years.  after the
seven years were over he had said all that he had to say, for his
conversation was limited, and he determined to return to his own
castle.  when he arrived he saw the children playing in the garden.
"what are you doing here?" he cried in a very gruff voice, and the
children ran away.
"my own garden is my own garden," said the giant; "any one can
understand that, and i will allow nobody to play in it but myself."
so he built a high wall all round it, and put up a notice-board.
trespassers
will be
prosecuted
he was a very selfish giant.
the poor children had now nowhere to play.  they tried to play on
the road, but the road was very dusty and full of hard stones, and
they did not like it.  they used to wander round the high wall when
their lessons were over, and talk about the beautiful garden
inside.  "how happy we were there," they said to each other.
then the spring came, and all over the country there were little
blossoms and little birds.  only in the garden of the selfish giant
it was still winter.  the birds did not care to sing in it as there
were no children, and the trees forgot to blossom.  once a
beautiful flower put its head out from the grass, but when it saw
the notice-board it was so sorry for the children that it slipped
back into the ground again, and went off to sleep.  the only people
who were pleased were the snow and the frost.  "spring has
forgotten this garden," they cried, "so we will live here all the
year round."  the snow covered up the grass with her great white
cloak, and the frost painted all the trees silver.  then they
invited the north wind to stay with them, and he came.  he was
wrapped in furs, and he roared all day about the garden, and blew
the chimney-pots down.  "this is a delightful spot," he said, "we
must ask the hail on a visit."  so the hail came.  every day for
three hours he rattled on the roof of the castle till he broke most
of the slates, and then he ran round and round the garden as fast
as he could go.  he was dressed in grey, and his breath was like
ice.
"i cannot understand why the spring is so late in coming," said the
selfish giant, as he sat at the window and looked out at his cold
white garden; "i hope there will be a change in the weather."
but the spring never came, nor the summer.  the autumn gave golden
fruit to every garden, but to the giants garden she gave none.
"he is too selfish," she said.  so it was always winter there, and
the north wind, and the hail, and the frost, and the snow danced
about through the trees.
one morning the giant was lying awake in bed when he heard some
lovely music.  it sounded so sweet to his ears that he thought it
must be the kings musicians passing by.  it was really only a
little linnet singing outside his window, but it was so long since
he had heard a bird sing in his garden that it seemed to him to be
the most beautiful music in the world.  then the hail stopped
dancing over his head, and the north wind ceased roaring, and a
delicious perfume came to him through the open casement.  "i
believe the spring has come at last," said the giant; and he jumped
out of bed and looked out.
what did he see?
he saw a most wonderful sight.  through a little hole in the wall
the children had crept in, and they were sitting in the branches of
the trees.  in every tree that he could see there was a little
child.  and the trees were so glad to have the children back again
that they had covered themselves with blossoms, and were waving
their arms gently above the childrens heads.  the birds were
flying about and twittering with delight, and the flowers were
looking up through the green grass and laughing.  it was a lovely
scene, only in one corner it was still winter.  it was the farthest
corner of the garden, and in it was standing a little boy.  he was
so small that he could not reach up to the branches of the tree,
and he was wandering all round it, crying bitterly.  the poor tree
was still quite covered with frost and snow, and the north wind was
blowing and roaring above it.  "climb up! little boy," said the
tree, and it bent its branches down as low as it could; but the boy
was too tiny.
and the giants heart melted as he looked out.  "how selfish i have
been!" he said; "now i know why the spring would not come here.  i
will put that poor little boy on the top of the tree, and then i
will knock down the wall, and my garden shall be the childrens
playground for ever and ever."  he was really very sorry for what
he had done.
so he crept downstairs and opened the front door quite softly, and
went out into the garden.  but when the children saw him they were
so frightened that they all ran away, and the garden became winter
again.  only the little boy did not run, for his eyes were so full
of tears that he did not see the giant coming.  and the giant stole
up behind him and took him gently in his hand, and put him up into
the tree.  and the tree broke at once into blossom, and the birds
came and sang on it, and the little boy stretched out his two arms
and flung them round the giants neck, and kissed him.  and the
other children, when they saw that the giant was not wicked any
longer, came running back, and with them came the spring.  "it is
your garden now, little children," said the giant, and he took a
great axe and knocked down the wall.  and when the people were
going to market at twelve oclock they found the giant playing with
the children in the most beautiful garden they had ever seen.
all day long they played, and in the evening they came to the giant
to bid him good-bye.
"but where is your little companion?" he said:  "the boy i put into
the tree."  the giant loved him the best because he had kissed him.
"we dont know," answered the children; "he has gone away."
"you must tell him to be sure and come here to-morrow," said the
giant.  but the children said that they did not know where he
lived, and had never seen him before; and the giant felt very sad.
every afternoon, when school was over, the children came and played
with the giant.  but the little boy whom the giant loved was never
seen again.  the giant was very kind to all the children, yet he
longed for his first little friend, and often spoke of him.  "how i
would like to see him!" he used to say.
years went over, and the giant grew very old and feeble.  he could
not play about any more, so he sat in a huge armchair, and watched
the children at their games, and admired his garden.  "i have many
beautiful flowers," he said; "but the children are the most
beautiful flowers of all."
one winter morning he looked out of his window as he was dressing.
he did not hate the winter now, for he knew that it was merely the
spring asleep, and that the flowers were resting.
suddenly he rubbed his eyes in wonder, and looked and looked.  it
certainly was a marvellous sight.  in the farthest corner of the
garden was a tree quite covered with lovely white blossoms.  its
branches were all golden, and silver fruit hung down from them, and
underneath it stood the little boy he had loved.
downstairs ran the giant in great joy, and out into the garden.  he
hastened across the grass, and came near to the child.  and when he
came quite close his face grew red with anger, and he said, "who
hath dared to wound thee?"  for on the palms of the childs hands
were the prints of two nails, and the prints of two nails were on
the little feet.
"who hath dared to wound thee?" cried the giant; "tell me, that i
may take my big sword and slay him."
"nay!" answered the child; "but these are the wounds of love."
"who art thou?" said the giant, and a strange awe fell on him, and
he knelt before the little child.
and the child smiled on the giant, and said to him, "you let me
play once in your garden, to-day you shall come with me to my
garden, which is paradise."
and when the children ran in that afternoon, they found the giant
lying dead under the tree, all covered with white blossoms.

忠实的朋友

忠实的朋友
一天早晨，老河鼠从自己的洞中探出头来。他长着明亮的小眼睛和硬挺的灰色胡须，尾
巴长得像一条长长的黑色橡胶。小鸭子们在池塘里游着水，看上去就像是一大群金丝鸟。他
们的母亲浑身纯白如雪，再配上一对赤红的腿，正尽力教他们如何头朝下地在水中倒立。
“除非你们学会倒立，否则你们永远不会进入上流社会，”她老爱这么对他们说，并不
停地做给他们看。但是小鸭子们并未对她的话引起重视。他们太年轻了，一点也不知道在上
流社会的好处是什么。
“多么顽皮的孩子呀！”老河鼠高声喊道，“他们真该被淹死。”
“不是那么回事，”鸭妈妈回答说，“万事开头难嘛，做父母的要多一点耐心。”
“啊：我完全不了解做父母的情感，”河鼠说，“我不是个养家带口的人。事实上，我
从未结过婚，也决不打算结婚。爱情本身倒是挺好的，但友情比它的价值更高。说实在的，
我不知道在这世上还有什么比忠实的友谊更崇高和更珍贵的了。”
“那么，请问，你认为一个忠实的朋友的责任是什么呢？”一只绿色的红雀开口问道，
此时他正坐在旁边一视柳树上，偷听到他们的谈话。
“是啊，这正是我想知道的，”鸭妈妈说。接着她就游到了池塘的另一头，头朝下倒立
起来，为的是给孩子们做一个好榜样。
“这问题问得多笨！”河鼠吼道，“当然，我肯定我忠实的朋友对我是忠实的。”
“那么你又用什么报答呢？”小鸟说着，跳上了一根银色的枝头，并扑打着他的小翅膀。
“我不明白你的意思，”河鼠回答说。
“那就让我给你讲一个这方面的故事吧，”红雀说。
“是关于我的故事吗？”河鼠问道，“如果是这样的话，我很愿意听，因为我特别喜欢
听故事。”
“它也适合你，”红雀回答说。他飞了下来，站立在河岸边，讲述起那个《忠实的朋
友》的故事。
“很久很久以前，”红雀说，“有一个诚实的小伙子名叫汉斯。”
“他是非常出色的吗？”河鼠问道。
“不，”红雀答道，“我认为他一点也不出色，只是心肠好罢了，还长着一张滑稽而友
善的圆脸。他独自一人住在小村舍里，每天都在自己的花园里干活。整个乡下没有谁家的花
园像他的花园那样可爱。里面长着美国石竹，还有紫罗兰、有荠，以及法国的松雪草。有粉
红色的玫瑰、金黄色的玫瑰，还有番红花，紫罗兰有金色的、紫色的和白色的。随着季节的
更迭，耧斗菜和碎米荠，牛膝草和野兰香，莲香花和鸢尾草，水仙和丁香都争相开放。一种
花刚凋谢，另一种便怒放开来，花园中一直都有美丽的花朵供人观赏，始终都有怡人的芳香
可闻。
“小汉斯有许多朋友，但是最忠实的朋友只有磨坊主大休。的确，有钱的磨坊主对小汉
斯是非常忠实的，每次他从小汉斯的花园经过总要从围墙上俯过身去摘上一大束鲜花，或者
摘上一把香草。遇到硕果累累的季节，他就会往口袋里装满李子和樱桃。
“磨坊主时常对小汉斯说，‘真正的朋友应该共享一切。’小汉斯微笑着点点头，他为
自己有一位思想如此崇高的朋友而深感骄傲。
“的确，有时候邻居们也感到奇怪，有钱的磨坊主从来没有给过小汉斯任何东西作为回
报，尽管他在自己的磨坊里存放了一百袋面粉，还有六头奶牛和一大群绵羊。不过，小汉斯
从没有为这些事而动过脑筋，再说经常听磨坊主对他谈起那些不自私的真正友谊的美妙故
事，对小汉斯来说，没有比听到这些更让他快乐的了。
“就这样小汉斯一直在花园中干着活。在春、夏、秋三季中他都很快乐，可冬天一到，
他没有水果和鲜花拿到市场上去卖，就要过饥寒交迫的日子，还常常吃不上晚饭，只吃点干
梨和核桃就上床睡觉了。在冬天的日子里，他觉得特别的孤单，因为这时磨坊主从来不会去
看望他。
“磨坊主常常对自己的妻子说，‘只要雪没有停，就没有必要去看小汉斯，因为人在困
难的时候，就应该让他们独处，不要让外人去打搅他们。这至少是我对友谊的看法，我相信
自己是对的，所以我要等到春天到来，那时我会去看望他，他还会送我一大篮樱草，这会使
他非常愉快的。’
“‘你的确为别人想得很周到，’他的妻子答道。她此刻正安坐在舒适的沙发椅上，旁
边燃着一大炉柴火，‘的确很周到。你谈论起友谊可真有一套，我敢说就是牧师本人也说不
出这么美丽的话语，尽管他能住在三层楼的房子里，小手指头上还戴着金成指。’
“‘不过我们就不能请小汉斯来这里吗？’磨坊主的小儿子说，‘如果可怜的汉斯遇到
困难的话，我会把我的粥分一半给他，还会把我那些小白兔给他看。’
“‘你真是个傻孩子！’磨坊主大声渠道，‘我真不知道送你上学有什么用处。你好像
什么也没有学会。噢，假如小汉斯来这里的话，看见我们暖和的炉火，看见我们丰盛的晚
餐，以及大桶的红酒，他可能会妒忌的，而妒忌是一件非常可怕的事情，它会毁了一个人的
品性。我当然不愿意把小汉斯的品性给毁了，我是他最要好的朋友，我要一直照顾他，并留
心他不受任何诱惑的欺骗。再说，如果小汉斯来到我家，他也许会要我赊点面粉给他，这我
可办不到。面粉是一件事，友谊又是另一件事，两者不能混为一谈。对呀，这两个词拼写起
来差别很大，意思也大不一样。每个人都清楚这一点。’
“‘你讲得真好’！磨坊主的妻子说，给自己倒了一大杯温暖的淡啤酒，‘我真的感到
很困了，就像是坐在教堂里听讲道一样。’
“‘很多人都做得不错，’磨坊主回答说，‘可说得好的人却寥寥无几，可见在两件事
中讲话更难一些，也更加迷人一些。’他用严厉的目光望着桌子另一头的小儿子，小儿子感
到很不好意思，低下了头，涨红着脸，泪水也忍不住地掉进了茶杯中。不过，他年纪这么
小，你们还是要原谅他。”
“故事就这么完了吗？”河鼠问。
“当然没有，”红雀回答说，“这只是个开头。”
“那么你就太落后了，”河鼠说，“当今那些故事高手们都是从结尾讲起，然后到开
头，最后才讲到中间。这是新方法。这些话是我那天从一位评论家那儿听来的，当时他正同
一位年轻人在池塘边散步。对这个问题他作了好一番高谈阔论，我相信他是正确的，因他戴
着一副蓝色的眼镜，头也全秃了，而且只要年轻人一开口讲话，他就总回答说，‘呸！’不
过，还是请你把故事讲下去吧。我尤其喜欢那个磨坊主。我自己也有各种美丽的情感，所以
我与他是同病相怜。”
“呵，”红雀说，他时而用这一只脚跳，时而又用另一只脚跳。“冬天刚一过去，樱草
开始开放它们的浅黄色星花的时候，磨坊主便对他的妻子说，他准备下山去看望一下小汉斯。
“‘啊，你的心肠真好！’他的妻子大声喊道，‘你总是想着别人。别忘了带上装花朵
的大篮子。’
“于是磨坊主用一根坚实的铁链把风车的翼板固定在一起，随后将篮子挎在手膀上就下
山去了。
“‘早上好，小汉斯，’磨坊主说。
“‘早上好，’汉斯回答道，把身体靠在铁铲上，满脸堆着笑容。
“‘整个冬天你都过得好吗？’磨坊主又开口问道。
“‘啊，是啊，’汉斯大声说，‘蒙你相问，你真是太好了，太好了。我要说我过得是
有些困难，不过现在春天已经到了，我好快活呀，我的花都长得很好。’
“‘今年冬天我们常提起你，’磨坊主说，‘还关心你过得怎么样了。’
“‘太感谢你了，’汉斯说，‘我真有点担心你会把我给忘了。’
“‘汉斯，你说的话让我吃惊，’磨坊主说；‘友谊从不会让人忘记，这就是友谊的非
凡所在，但是只恐怕你还不懂得生活的诗意。啊，对了，你的樱草长得多可爱呀！’
“‘它们长得确实可爱，’汉斯说，‘我的运气太好了，会有这么多的樱草。我要把它
们拿到市场上去卖，卖给市长的女儿，有了钱就去赎回我的小推车。’
“‘赎回你的小推车？你的意思是说你卖掉了它？这事你做的有多么傻呀！’
“‘噢，事实上，’汉斯说，‘我不得不那样做。你知道冬天对我来说是很困难的，我
也的确没钱买面包。所以我先是卖掉星期日制服上的银钮扣，然后又卖掉银链条，接着卖掉
了我的大烟斗，最后才卖掉了我的小推车。不过，我现在要把它们都再买回来。’
“‘汉斯，’磨坊主说，‘我愿意把我的小推车送给你。它还没有完全修好，其实，它
有一边已掉了，轮缘也有些毛病，但不管怎么说，我还是要把它送给你。我知道我这个人非
常慷慨，而且很多人会认为我送掉小车是很愚蠢的举动，但是我是与众不同的人。我认为慷
慨是友谊的核心。再说，我还给自己弄了一辆新的小推车。好了，你就放宽心吧，我要把我
的小推车给你的。’
“‘啊，你太慷慨了，’小汉斯说着，那张滑稽有趣的圆脸上洋溢着喜气。‘我会毫不
费力地把它修好，因为我屋里就有一块木板。’
“‘一块木板！’磨坊主说，‘对了，我正好想要一块木板来修补我的仓顶。那上面有
一个大洞，如果我不堵住它，麦子就会被淋湿。多亏你提到这事：一件好事总会产生另一件
好事，这真是不可思议。我已经把我的小推车给了你，现在你要把木板给我了。其实，小车
比木板要值钱得多，不过真正的友谊从来不会留意这种事的。请快把木板拿来，我今天就动
手去修我的仓房。’
“‘当然了，’小汉斯大声说，随即跑进他的小屋，把木板拖了出米。
“‘这木板不太大，’磨坊主望着木板说，‘恐怕等我修完仓顶后就没有剩下来给你修
补小推车的了，不过这当然不是我的错。而且现在我已经把我的小推车给了你，我相信你一
定乐意给我一些花作回报的。给你篮子，注意请给我的篮子装满了。’
“‘要装满吗？’小汉斯问着，脸上显得很不安，因为这可真是一个大篮子，他心里明
白，要是把这只篮子装满的话，他就不会有鲜花剩下来拿到集市上去卖了，再说他又非常想
把银钮扣赎回来。
“‘噢，对了，’磨坊主回答说，‘既然我已经把自己的小推车给了你，我觉得向你要
一些花也算不了什么。也许我是错了，但是我认为友谊，真正的友谊，是不会夹带任何私心
的。’
“‘我亲爱的朋友，我最好的朋友，’小汉斯喊了起来，‘我这花园里所有的花都供你
享用。我宁愿早一点听到你的美言，至于银钮扣哪一天去赎都可以。’说完他就跑去把花园
里所有的美丽樱草都摘了下来，装满了磨坊主的篮子。
“‘再见了，小汉斯，’磨坊主说。他肩上扛着木板，手里提着大篮子朝山上走去了。
“‘再见，’小汉斯说，然后他又开始高高兴兴地挖起土来，那辆小推车使他兴奋不已。
“第二天，小汉斯正往门廊上钉忍冬的时候，听见磨坊主在马路上喊叫他的声音。他一
下子从梯子上跳下来，跑到花园里，朝墙外望去。
“只见磨坊主扛着一大袋面粉站在外面。
“‘亲爱的小汉斯，’磨坊主说，‘你愿意帮我把这袋面粉背到集市上去吗？’
一牧，实在对不起，’汉斯说，‘我今天真的太忙了。我要把所有的藤子全钉好，还得
把所有的花浇上水，所有的草都剪平。’
“‘啊，不错，’磨坊主说，“我想是的。可你要考虑我将把我的小推车送给你，你要
是拒绝我就太不够朋友了。’
“‘啊，不要这么说，’小汉斯大声叫道，‘无论如何我也不会对不起朋友的。’他跑
进小屋去取帽子，然后扛上那大袋面粉，步履艰难地朝集市走去。
“这一天天气炎热，路上尘土飞扬，汉斯还没有走到六英里，就累得不行了，只好坐下
来歇歇脚。不过，他又继续勇敢地上路了，最后终于到达了集市。在那儿他没有等多长时
间，就把那袋面粉卖掉了，还卖了个好价钱。他立即动身回家，因为他担心在集市上呆得太
晚，回去的路上可能会遇上强盗的。
“‘今天的确太辛苦了，’小汉斯上床睡觉时这样对自己说，‘不过我很高兴没有拒绝
磨坊主，因为他是我最好的朋友，再说，他还要把他的小推车送给我。’
“第二天一大早，磨坊主就下山来取他那袋面粉的钱，可是小汉斯太累了，这时还躺在
床上睡觉呢。
“‘我得说，’磨坊主说，‘你实在是很懒，想一想我就要把我的小推车送给你，你本
该工作得更勤奋才对。懒情是一件大罪，我当然不喜欢我的朋友是个懒汉了。你当然不会怪
我对你讲了这一番直言，假如我不是你的朋友，我自然也不会这么做的。但是如果人们不能
坦诚地说出自己的心里话，那么友谊还有什么意思可言。任何人都可以说漂亮话，可以取悦
人，也可以讨好人，然而真正的朋友才总是说逆耳的话，而且不怕给人找苦头吃。的确，只
要一位真正的忠实的朋友乐意这么做的话，那么原因就在于他知道他正在做好事。’
“‘很对不起，’小汉斯一面说，一面揉着自己的眼睛，脱下了他的睡帽，‘不过我真
是太累了，我想的只是再睡一小会儿，听听鸟儿的歌声。你知道吗，每当我听过鸟儿的歌声
我会干得更起劲的？’
“‘好，这让我很高兴，’磨坊主拍拍小汉斯的肩膀说，‘我只想让你穿好衣服立即到
我的磨房来，给我修补一下仓房顶。’
“可怜的小汉斯当时很想到自己的花园里去干活，因为他的花草已有两天没浇过水了，
可他又不想拒绝磨坊主，磨坊主是他的好朋友哇。
“‘如果我说我很忙，你会认为我不够朋友吗？’他又害羞又担心地问道。
“‘噢，说实在的，’磨坊主回答说，‘我觉得我对你的要求并不过分，你想我就要把
我的小推车给你，不过当然如果你不想干，我就回去自己动手干。’
“‘啊！那怎么行，’小汉斯嚷着说。他从床上跳下来，穿上衣服，往仓房去了。
“他在那儿干了整整一天，直到夕阳西下，日落时分磨坊主来看他干得怎么样了。
“‘小汉斯，你把仓顶上的洞补好了吗？’磨坊主乐不可支地高声问道。
“‘全补好了，’小汉斯说着，从梯子上走了下来。
“‘啊！’磨坊主说，‘没有什么比替别人干活更让人快乐的了。’
“‘听你说话真是莫大的荣幸，’小汉斯坐下身来，一边擦去前额的汗水，一边回答
说，‘莫大的荣幸，不过我担心我永远也不会有你这么美好的想法。’
“‘啊！你也会有的，’磨坊主说，‘不过你必须得更努力些才行。现在你仅仅完成了
友谊的实践，今后有一天你也会具备理论的。’
“‘你真的认为我会吗？’小汉斯问。
“‘我对此毫不怀疑，’磨坊主回答说，‘不过既然你已经修补好了仓顶，你最好还是
回去休息，因为我明天还要你帮我赶山羊到山上去。’
“‘可怜的小汉斯对这件事什么也不敢说，第二天一大早磨坊主就赶着他的羊群来到了
小屋旁，汉斯便赶着它们上山去了。他花了整整一天功夫才走了一个来回。回到家时他已经
累坏了，就坐在椅子上睡着了，一觉醒来已经是大天亮了。
“‘今天能呆在自己的花园里我会是多么快乐呀。’说着，他就马上去干活了。
“然而他永远也不能够全身心地去照料好自己的花，因为他的朋友磨坊主老是不停地跑
来给他派些差事，或叫他到磨坊去帮忙。有时小汉斯也很苦恼，他担心自己的花会认为他已
经把它们给忘了，但是他却用磨坊主是自己最好的朋友这种想法来安慰自己。‘再说，’他
经常对自己说，‘他还要把自己的小推车送给我，那是真正慷慨大方的举动。’
“就这样小汉斯不停地为磨坊主干事，而磨坊主也讲了各种各样关于友谊的美妙语句，
汉斯把这些话都记在笔记本上，晚上经常拿出来阅读，因为他还是个爱读书的人。
“有一天晚上，小汉斯正坐在炉旁烤火，忽然传来了响亮的敲门声。这是个气候恶劣的
夜晚，风一个劲地在小屋周围狂欢乱咀。起初他还以为听到的只是风暴声呢，可是又传来了
第二次敲门声，接着是第三次，而且比前两次更响亮。
“‘这是个可怜的行路人，’小汉斯对自己说，而且朝门口跑去。
“原来门口站着的是磨坊主，他一只手里提着一个马灯，另一只手中拿着一根大拐杖。
“‘亲爱的小汉斯，’磨坊主大声叫道，‘我遇到大麻烦了。我的小儿子从梯子上掉下
来了，受了伤，我准备去请医生。可是医生住的地方太远，今晚的天气又如此恶劣，我刚才
突然觉得要是你替我去请医生，会好得多。你知道我将要把我的小推车送给你，所以你应该
为我做些事来作为回报，才算是公平的。’
“‘当然罗，’小汉斯大声说道，‘我觉得你能来找我是我的荣幸，我这就动身。不过
你得把马灯借给我，今夜太黑了，我担心自己跌到水沟里去。’
“‘很对不起，’磨坊主回答说，‘这可是我的新马灯，如果它出了什么毛病，那对我
的损失可就大了。’
“‘噢，没关系，我不用它也行。’小汉斯高声说，他取下自己的皮大衣和暖和的红礼
帽，又在自己的脖子上围上一条围巾，就动身了。
“那可真是个可怕的风暴之夜，黑得伸手不见五指，小汉斯什么也看不见。风刮得很
猛，他连站都站不稳。不过，小汉斯非常勇敢，他走了大约三个钟头，来到了医生的屋前，
敲响了门。
“‘是谁呀？’医生从卧室伸出头来大声问道。
“‘医生，我是小汉斯。’
“‘什么事，小汉斯。’
“‘磨坊主的儿子从梯子上跌下来摔伤了，磨坊主请你马上去。”
“‘好的！’医生说，并且叫人去备马。他取来大靴子，提上马灯，从楼上走了下来，
骑上马朝磨坊主的家奔去，而小汉斯却步履踏酒地跟在后头。
“然而风暴却越来越大，雨下得像小河的流水，小汉斯看不清他面前的路面，也赶不上
马了。最后他迷了路，在一片沼泽地上徘徊着。这是一块非常危险的地方，到处有深深的水
坑，可怜的小汉斯就在那里给淹死了。第二天几位牧羊人发现了他的尸首，漂浮在一个大池
塘的水面上。这几位牧羊人把尸体抬回到他的小屋中。哀悼仪式的主持人。
“‘既然我是他最好的沥友，’磨坊主说，‘那么就应该让我站最好的位置。’所以他
穿一身黑色的长袍走在送葬队伍的最前边，还时不时地用一块大手帕抹着眼泪水。
“‘小汉斯的死的确对每一个人都是个大损失，’铁匠开口说。这时葬礼已经结束，大
家都舒适地坐在小酒店里，喝着香料酒，吃着甜点心。
“‘无论如何对我是个大损失，’磨坊主回答说，‘对了，我都快把我的小推车送给他
了，现在我真不知怎么处理它了。放在我家里对我是个大妨碍，它已经破烂不堪，就是卖掉
它我又能得到什么。我今后更要留心不再送人任何东西。大方总让人吃苦头。’”
“后来呢？”过了好一会儿河鼠说。
“什么，我讲完了，”红雀说。
“可是磨坊主后来又怎样了呢？’河鼠问道。
“噢！我真的不清楚，”红雀回答说，“我觉得我不关心这个。”
“很显然你的本性中没有同情的成分，”河鼠说。
“我恐怕你还没有弄明白这故事中的教义，”红雀反驳说。
“什么？”河鼠大声暖道。
“教义。”
“你的意思是说这故事里还有一个教义？”
“当然了，”红雀说。
“噢，说真的，”河鼠气呼呼地说，“我认为你在讲故事之前就该告诉我那个。如果你
那样做了，我肯定不会听你的了。其实，我该像批评家那样说一声‘呸！’但是，我现在可
以这么说了。”于是他就大喊了一声“呸！”，并挥舞了一下自己的尾巴，就回到了山洞中
去。
“你觉得河鼠怎么样？”母鸭开口问道，她用了好几分钟才拍打着水走上岸来。“他也
有好些优点，不过就我而言，我有一个母亲的情怀，只要看见那些铁了心不结婚的单身汉总
忍不住要掉下眼泪来。”
“我真担心我把他给得罪了，”红雀回答说，“事实是我给他讲了一个带教义的故事。”
“啊，这事总是很危险的，”母鸭说。
我完全同意她的话。
the devoted friend
one morning the old water-rat put his head out of his hole.  he had
bright beady eyes and stiff grey whiskers and his tail was like a
long bit of black india-rubber.  the little ducks were swimming
about in the pond, looking just like a lot of yellow canaries, and
their mother, who was pure white with real red legs, was trying to
teach them how to stand on their heads in the water.
"you will never be in the best society unless you can stand on your
heads," she kept saying to them; and every now and then she showed
them how it was done.  but the little ducks paid no attention to
her.  they were so young that they did not know what an advantage
it is to be in society at all.
"what disobedient children!" cried the old water-rat; "they really
deserve to be drowned."
"nothing of the kind," answered the duck, "every one must make a
beginning, and parents cannot be too patient."
"ah! i know nothing about the feelings of parents," said the water-
rat; "i am not a family man.  in fact, i have never been married,
and i never intend to be.  love is all very well in its way, but
friendship is much higher.  indeed, i know of nothing in the world
that is either nobler or rarer than a devoted friendship."
"and what, pray, is your idea of the duties of a devoted friend?"
asked a green linnet, who was sitting in a willow-tree hard by, and
had overheard the conversation.
"yes, that is just what i want to know," said the duck; and she
swam away to the end of the pond, and stood upon her head, in order
to give her children a good example.
"what a silly question!" cried the water-rat.  "i should expect my
devoted friend to be devoted to me, of course."
"and what would you do in return?" said the little bird, swinging
upon a silver spray, and flapping his tiny wings.
"i dont understand you," answered the water-rat.
"let me tell you a story on the subject," said the linnet.
"is the story about me?" asked the water-rat.  "if so, i will
listen to it, for i am extremely fond of fiction."
"it is applicable to you," answered the linnet; and he flew down,
and alighting upon the bank, he told the story of the devoted
friend.
"once upon a time," said the linnet, "there was an honest little
fellow named hans."
"was he very distinguished?" asked the water-rat.
"no," answered the linnet, "i dont think he was distinguished at
all, except for his kind heart, and his funny round good-humoured
face.  he lived in a tiny cottage all by himself, and every day he
worked in his garden.  in all the country-side there was no garden
so lovely as his.  sweet-william grew there, and gilly-flowers, and
shepherds-purses, and fair-maids of france.  there were damask
roses, and yellow roses, lilac crocuses, and gold, purple violets
and white.  columbine and ladysmock, marjoram and wild basil, the
cowslip and the flower-de-luce, the daffodil and the clove-pink
bloomed or blossomed in their proper order as the months went by,
one flower taking another flowers place, so that there were always
beautiful things to look at, and pleasant odours to smell.
"little hans had a great many friends, but the most devoted friend
of all was big hugh the miller.  indeed, so devoted was the rich
miller to little hans, that be would never go by his garden without
leaning over the wall and plucking a large nosegay, or a handful of
sweet herbs, or filling his pockets with plums and cherries if it
was the fruit season.
"real friends should have everything in common, the miller used
to say, and little hans nodded and smiled, and felt very proud of
having a friend with such noble ideas.
"sometimes, indeed, the neighbours thought it strange that the rich
miller never gave little hans anything in return, though he had a
hundred sacks of flour stored away in his mill, and six milch cows,
and a large flock of woolly sheep; but hans never troubled his head
about these things, and nothing gave him greater pleasure than to
listen to all the wonderful things the miller used to say about the
unselfishness of true friendship.
"so little hans worked away in his garden.  during the spring, the
summer, and the autumn he was very happy, but when the winter came,
and he had no fruit or flowers to bring to the market, he suffered
a good deal from cold and hunger, and often had to go to bed
without any supper but a few dried pears or some hard nuts.  in the
winter, also, he was extremely lonely, as the miller never came to
see him then.
"there is no good in my going to see little hans as long as the
snow lasts, the miller used to say to his wife, for when people
are in trouble they should be left alone, and not be bothered by
visitors.  that at least is my idea about friendship, and i am sure
i am right.  so i shall wait till the spring comes, and then i
shall pay him a visit, and he will be able to give me a large
basket of primroses and that will make him so happy.
"you are certainly very thoughtful about others, answered the
wife, as she sat in her comfortable armchair by the big pinewood
fire; very thoughtful indeed.  it is quite a treat to hear you
talk about friendship.  i am sure the clergyman himself could not
say such beautiful things as you do, though he does live in a
three-storied house, and wear a gold ring on his little finger.
"but could we not ask little hans up here? said the millers
youngest son.  if poor hans is in trouble i will give him half my
porridge, and show him my white rabbits.
"what a silly boy you are! cried the miller; i really dont know
what is the use of sending you to school.  you seem not to learn
anything.  why, if little hans came up here, and saw our warm fire,
and our good supper, and our great cask of red wine, he might get
envious, and envy is a most terrible thing, and would spoil
anybodys nature.  i certainly will not allow hans nature to be
spoiled.  i am his best friend, and i will always watch over him,
and see that he is not led into any temptations.  besides, if hans
came here, he might ask me to let him have some flour on credit,
and that i could not do.  flour is one thing, and friendship is
another, and they should not be confused.  why, the words are spelt
differently, and mean quite different things.  everybody can see
that.
"how well you talk! said the millers wife, pouring herself out a
large glass of warm ale; really i feel quite drowsy.  it is just
like being in church.
"lots of people act well, answered the miller; but very few
people talk well, which shows that talking is much the more
difficult thing of the two, and much the finer thing also; and he
looked sternly across the table at his little son, who felt so
ashamed of himself that he hung his head down, and grew quite
scarlet, and began to cry into his tea.  however, he was so young
that you must excuse him."
"is that the end of the story?" asked the water-rat.
"certainly not," answered the linnet, "that is the beginning."
"then you are quite behind the age," said the water-rat.  "every
good story-teller nowadays starts with the end, and then goes on to
the beginning, and concludes with the middle.  that is the new
method.  i heard all about it the other day from a critic who was
walking round the pond with a young man.  he spoke of the matter at
great length, and i am sure he must have been right, for he had
blue spectacles and a bald head, and whenever the young man made
any remark, he always answered pooh!  but pray go on with your
story.  i like the miller immensely.  i have all kinds of beautiful
sentiments myself, so there is a great sympathy between us."
"well," said the linnet, hopping now on one leg and now on the
other, "as soon as the winter was over, and the primroses began to
open their pale yellow stars, the miller said to his wife that he
would go down and see little hans.
"why, what a good heart you have! cried his wife; you are always
thinking of others.  and mind you take the big basket with you for
the flowers.
"so the miller tied the sails of the windmill together with a
strong iron chain, and went down the hill with the basket on his
arm.
"good morning, little hans, said the miller.
"good morning, said hans, leaning on his spade, and smiling from
ear to ear.
"and how have you been all the winter? said the miller.
"well, really, cried hans, it is very good of you to ask, very
good indeed.  i am afraid i had rather a hard time of it, but now
the spring has come, and i am quite happy, and all my flowers are
doing well.
"we often talked of you during the winter, hans, said the miller,
and wondered how you were getting on.
"that was kind of you, said hans; i was half afraid you had
forgotten me.
"hans, i am surprised at you, said the miller; friendship never
forgets.  that is the wonderful thing about it, but i am afraid you
dont understand the poetry of life.  how lovely your primroses are
looking, by-the-bye"!
"they are certainly very lovely, said hans, and it is a most
lucky thing for me that i have so many.  i am going to bring them
into the market and sell them to the burgomasters daughter, and
buy back my wheelbarrow with the money.
"buy back your wheelbarrow?  you dont mean to say you have sold
it?  what a very stupid thing to do!
"well, the fact is, said hans, that i was obliged to.  you see
the winter was a very bad time for me, and i really had no money at
all to buy bread with.  so i first sold the silver buttons off my
sunday coat, and then i sold my silver chain, and then i sold my
big pipe, and at last i sold my wheelbarrow.  but i am going to buy
them all back again now.
"hans, said the miller, i will give you my wheelbarrow.  it is
not in very good repair; indeed, one side is gone, and there is
something wrong with the wheel-spokes; but in spite of that i will
give it to you.  i know it is very generous of me, and a great many
people would think me extremely foolish for parting with it, but i
am not like the rest of the world.  i think that generosity is the
essence of friendship, and, besides, i have got a new wheelbarrow
for myself.  yes, you may set your mind at ease, i will give you my
wheelbarrow.
"well, really, that is generous of you, said little hans, and his
funny round face glowed all over with pleasure.  i can easily put
it in repair, as i have a plank of wood in the house.
"a plank of wood! said the miller; why, that is just what i want
for the roof of my barn.  there is a very large hole in it, and the
corn will all get damp if i dont stop it up.  how lucky you
mentioned it!  it is quite remarkable how one good action always
breeds another.  i have given you my wheelbarrow, and now you are
going to give me your plank.  of course, the wheelbarrow is worth
far more than the plank, but true, friendship never notices things
like that.  pray get it at once, and i will set to work at my barn
this very day.
"certainly, cried little hans, and he ran into the shed and
dragged the plank out.
"it is not a very big plank, said the miller, looking at it, and
i am afraid that after i have mended my barn-roof there wont be
any left for you to mend the wheelbarrow with; but, of course, that
is not my fault.  and now, as i have given you my wheelbarrow, i am
sure you would like to give me some flowers in return.  here is the
basket, and mind you fill it quite full.
"quite full? said little hans, rather sorrowfully, for it was
really a very big basket, and he knew that if he filled it he would
have no flowers left for the market and he was very anxious to get
his silver buttons back.
"well, really, answered the miller, as i have given you my
wheelbarrow, i dont think that it is much to ask you for a few
flowers.  i may be wrong, but i should have thought that
friendship, true friendship, was quite free from selfishness of any
kind.
"my dear friend, my best friend, cried little hans, you are
welcome to all the flowers in my garden.  i would much sooner have
your good opinion than my silver buttons, any day; and he ran and
plucked all his pretty primroses, and filled the millers basket.
"good-bye, little hans, said the miller, as he went up the hill
with the plank on his shoulder, and the big basket in his hand.
"good-bye, said little hans, and he began to dig away quite
merrily, he was so pleased about the wheelbarrow.
"the next day he was nailing up some honeysuckle against the porch,
when he heard the millers voice calling to him from the road.  so
he jumped off the ladder, and ran down the garden, and looked over
the wall.
"there was the miller with a large sack of flour on his back.
"dear little hans, said the miller, would you mind carrying this
sack of flour for me to market?
"oh, i am so sorry, said hans, but i am really very busy to-day.
i have got all my creepers to nail up, and all my flowers to water,
and all my grass to roll.
"well, really, said the miller, i think that, considering that i
am going to give you my wheelbarrow, it is rather unfriendly of you
to refuse.
"oh, dont say that, cried little hans, i wouldnt be unfriendly
for the whole world; and he ran in for his cap, and trudged off
with the big sack on his shoulders.
"it was a very hot day, and the road was terribly dusty, and before
hans had reached the sixth milestone he was so tired that he had to
sit down and rest.  however, he went on bravely, and as last he
reached the market.  after he had waited there some time, he sold
the sack of flour for a very good price, and then he returned home
at once, for he was afraid that if he stopped too late he might
meet some robbers on the way.
"it has certainly been a hard day, said little hans to himself as
he was going to bed, but i am glad i did not refuse the miller,
for he is my best friend, and, besides, he is going to give me his
wheelbarrow.
"early the next morning the miller came down to get the money for
his sack of flour, but little hans was so tired that he was still
in bed.
"upon my word, said the miller, you are very lazy.  really,
considering that i am going to give you my wheelbarrow, i think you
might work harder.  idleness is a great sin, and i certainly dont
like any of my friends to be idle or sluggish.  you must not mind
my speaking quite plainly to you.  of course i should not dream of
doing so if i were not your friend.  but what is the good of
friendship if one cannot say exactly what one means?  anybody can
say charming things and try to please and to flatter, but a true
friend always says unpleasant things, and does not mind giving
pain.  indeed, if he is a really true friend he prefers it, for he
knows that then he is doing good.
"i am very sorry, said little hans, rubbing his eyes and pulling
off his night-cap, but i was so tired that i thought i would lie
in bed for a little time, and listen to the birds singing.  do you
know that i always work better after hearing the birds sing?
"well, i am glad of that, said the miller, clapping little hans
on the back, for i want you to come up to the mill as soon as you
are dressed, and mend my barn-roof for me.
"poor little hans was very anxious to go and work in his garden,
for his flowers had not been watered for two days, but he did not
like to refuse the miller, as he was such a good friend to him.
"do you think it would be unfriendly of me if i said i was busy?
he inquired in a shy and timid voice.
"well, really, answered the miller, i do not think it is much to
ask of you, considering that i am going to give you my wheelbarrow;
but of course if you refuse i will go and do it myself.
"oh! on no account, cried little hans and he jumped out of bed,
and dressed himself, and went up to the barn.
"he worked there all day long, till sunset, and at sunset the
miller came to see how he was getting on.
"have you mended the hole in the roof yet, little hans? cried the
miller in a cheery voice.
"it is quite mended, answered little hans, coming down the
ladder.
"ah! said the miller, there is no work so delightful as the work
one does for others.
"it is certainly a great privilege to hear you talk, answered
little hans, sitting down, and wiping his forehead, a very great
privilege.  but i am afraid i shall never have such beautiful ideas
as you have.
"oh! they will come to you, said the miller, but you must take
more pains.  at present you have only the practice of friendship;
some day you will have the theory also.
"do you really think i shall? asked little hans.
"i have no doubt of it, answered the miller, but now that you
have mended the roof, you had better go home and rest, for i want
you to drive my sheep to the mountain to-morrow.
"poor little hans was afraid to say anything to this, and early the
next morning the miller brought his sheep round to the cottage, and
hans started off with them to the mountain.  it took him the whole
day to get there and back; and when he returned he was so tired
that he went off to sleep in his chair, and did not wake up till it
was broad daylight.
"what a delightful time i shall have in my garden, he said, and
he went to work at once.
"but somehow he was never able to look after his flowers at all,
for his friend the miller was always coming round and sending him
off on long errands, or getting him to help at the mill.  little
hans was very much distressed at times, as he was afraid his
flowers would think he had forgotten them, but he consoled himself
by the reflection that the miller was his best friend.  besides,
he used to say, he is going to give me his wheelbarrow, and that
is an act of pure generosity.
"so little hans worked away for the miller, and the miller said all
kinds of beautiful things about friendship, which hans took down in
a note-book, and used to read over at night, for he was a very good
scholar.
"now it happened that one evening little hans was sitting by his
fireside when a loud rap came at the door.  it was a very wild
night, and the wind was blowing and roaring round the house so
terribly that at first he thought it was merely the storm.  but a
second rap came, and then a third, louder than any of the others.
"it is some poor traveller, said little hans to himself, and he
ran to the door.
"there stood the miller with a lantern in one hand and a big stick
in the other.
"dear little hans, cried the miller, i am in great trouble.  my
little boy has fallen off a ladder and hurt himself, and i am going
for the doctor.  but he lives so far away, and it is such a bad
night, that it has just occurred to me that it would be much better
if you went instead of me.  you know i am going to give you my
wheelbarrow, and so, it is only fair that you should do something
for me in return.
"certainly, cried little hans, i take it quite as a compliment
your coming to me, and i will start off at once.  but you must lend
me your lantern, as the night is so dark that i am afraid i might
fall into the ditch.
"i am very sorry, answered the miller, but it is my new lantern,
and it would be a great loss to me if anything happened to it.
"well, never mind, i will do without it, cried little hans, and
he took down his great fur coat, and his warm scarlet cap, and tied
a muffler round his throat, and started off.
"what a dreadful storm it was!  the night was so black that little
hans could hardly see, and the wind was so strong that he could
scarcely stand.  however, he was very courageous, and after he had
been walking about three hours, he arrived at the doctors house,
and knocked at the door.
"who is there? cried the doctor, putting his head out of his
bedroom window.
"little hans, doctor.
"what do you want, little hans?
"the millers son has fallen from a ladder, and has hurt himself,
and the miller wants you to come at once.
"all right! said the doctor; and he ordered his horse, and his
big boots, and his lantern, and came downstairs, and rode off in
the direction of the millers house, little hans trudging behind
him.
"but the storm grew worse and worse, and the rain fell in torrents,
and little hans could not see where he was going, or keep up with
the horse.  at last he lost his way, and wandered off on the moor,
which was a very dangerous place, as it was full of deep holes, and
there poor little hans was drowned.  his body was found the next
day by some goatherds, floating in a great pool of water, and was
brought back by them to the cottage.
"everybody went to little hans funeral, as he was so popular, and
the miller was the chief mourner.
"as i was his best friend, said the miller, it is only fair that
i should have the best place; so he walked at the head of the
procession in a long black cloak, and every now and then he wiped
his eyes with a big pocket-handkerchief.
"little hans is certainly a great loss to every one, said the
blacksmith, when the funeral was over, and they were all seated
comfortably in the inn, drinking spiced wine and eating sweet
cakes.
"a great loss to me at any rate, answered the miller; why, i had
as good as given him my wheelbarrow, and now i really dont know
what to do with it.  it is very much in my way at home, and it is
in such bad repair that i could not get anything for it if i sold
it.  i will certainly take care not to give away anything again.
one always suffers for being generous."
"well?" said the water-rat, after a long pause.
"well, that is the end," said the linnet.
"but what became of the miller?" asked the water-rat.
"oh!  i really dont know," replied the linnet; "and i am sure that
i dont care."
"it is quite evident then that you have no sympathy in your
nature," said the water-rat.
"i am afraid you dont quite see the moral of the story," remarked
the linnet.
"the what?" screamed the water-rat.
"the moral."
"do you mean to say that the story has a moral?"
"certainly," said the linnet.
"well, really," said the water-rat, in a very angry manner, "i
think you should have told me that before you began.  if you had
done so, i certainly would not have listened to you; in fact, i
should have said pooh, like the critic.  however, i can say it
now"; so he shouted out "pooh" at the top of his voice, gave a
whisk with his tail, and went back into his hole.
"and how do you like the water-rat?" asked the duck, who came
paddling up some minutes afterwards.  "he has a great many good
points, but for my own part i have a mothers feelings, and i can
never look at a confirmed bachelor without the tears coming into my
eyes."
"i am rather afraid that i have annoyed him," answered the linnet.
"the fact is, that i told him a story with a moral."
"ah! that is always a very dangerous thing to do," said the duck.
and i quite agree with her.

神奇的火箭
国王的儿子就要结婚了，所以要在举国上下进行庆典。他为自己的新娘已经等了整整一
年，最后她还是赶来了。她是一位俄国公主，坐着由六只驯鹿拉的雪橇从芬兰一路赶来的。
雪橇看上去像一只巨大的金色天鹅，小公主就安卧在天鹏的两只翅膀之间。那件长长的貂皮
大衣一直垂到她的脚跟，她的头上戴着一顶小巧的银线帽子，她的肤色苍白得就如同她一直
居住的雪宫的颜色。她是如此的苍白，在她驶过街道的时候，沿街的人们都惊讶地叹道：
“她就像一朵白玫瑰！”于是大家纷纷从阳台上朝她抛下鲜花。
在城堡的门口王子正等着迎接她的到来。他有一双梦幻般的紫色眼睛和一头金黄色的头
发。一看见她来了，他就跪下一条腿，吻了她的手。
“你的照片好漂亮，”他轻声地说，“不过你比照片更漂亮。”小公主的脸一下子就红
了。
“她先前像一朵白攻瑰，”一位年轻的侍卫对身边的人说，“可此刻却像一朵红玫瑰
了。”整个宫里的人都快乐无比。
这以后的三天中人人都说着：“白玫瑰，红玫瑰；红玫瑰，白玫瑰。”于是国王下令给
那个侍卫的薪金增加一倍。不过他根本就没有拿薪水，因此这道加薪的命令对他没有任何作
用，然而这被视为一种莫大的荣誉，并按惯例在宫廷报纸上登出。
三天过后便举行了婚礼庆典。这是一次盛大的仪式，新郎和新娘在一幅绣着小珍珠的紫
色鹅绒华盖下手牵着手走着。接着又举行了国宴，持续了五个小时。王子和公主坐在大厅的
首座上，用一只纯清的水晶杯子饮酒。只有真诚的恋人才能用这只杯子喝酒，因为只要虚伪
的嘴唇一挨上杯子，杯子就会变得灰暗无光。
“一眼就能看出他们相亲相爱，”那个小侍卫说，“如同水晶一样纯洁！”为这句话国
王再次下令给他加薪。“多么大的荣耀啊！”群臣们异口同声地喊道。
宴会之后举办了舞会，新郎和新娘将要一块儿跳舞，国王答应为他们吹笛子。他吹得很
不好，可没有人敢对他那么说，因为他是一国之君。说真的，他只会吹两种调子，并且从来
也没有搞清楚他吹的是哪一种，不过也无关紧要，因为不管他吹的是什么，人们都会高喊狂
叫：“棒极了！棒极了！”
这次节目的最后一个项目是施放盛大的烟花，燃放的时间正好定在午夜。小公主一生也
没有看过放烟花，因此国王下令皇家烟花手要亲自出席当天的婚礼以便施放烟花。
“烟花像什么样子？”有一天早上，小公主在露天阳台上散步时这样问过王子。
“它们就像北极光，”国王说，他一贯喜欢替别人回答问题，“只是更自然罢了。我本
人更喜欢烟花而不是星星，因为你一直都明白它们何时会出现，它们就如同我吹笛子一样美
妙。你一定要看看它们。”
就这样在皇家花园的尽头搭起了一座大台子。等皇家烟花手把一切都准备完毕，烟花们
便相互交谈起来。
“世界真是太美丽了，”一个小爆竹大声喊道，“看看那些黄色的郁金香。啊！如果它
们是真正的爆竹，它们会更逗人喜爱的。我很高兴我参加过旅游。旅游大大提高见识，并能
除去一切个人的偏见。”
“国王的花园不是世界，你这个傻爆竹，”一枚罗马烛光弹说，“世界是一个大得很的
地方，你要花三天时间才能看遍全世界。”
“任何地方只要你爱它，它就是你的世界，”一枚深思熟虑的转轮烟火激动地喊道。她
早年曾恋上了一只旧的杉木箱子，并以这段伤心的经历而自豪。“不过爱情已不再时髦了，
诗人们把它给扼杀了。他们对爱情抒发得太多，使人们不再相信那么回事。对此，我一点也
不觉得吃惊。真正的爱情是痛苦的、是沉默的。我记得自己曾有过那么一回——可是现在已
经结束了。浪漫只属于过去。”
“胡说！”罗马烛光弹说，“浪漫永远不会消亡，它犹如月亮一样，永远活着。比如，
新郎和新娘彼此爱得多么热烈。关于他们的故事我是今天早晨从一枚棕色纸做的爆竹那儿听
来的，他碰巧跟我同在一个抽屉里面，并且知道最新的宫中消息。”
可是只见转轮烟火摇摇头，喃喃地说，“浪漫已经消亡了，浪漫已经消亡了，已经消亡
了。”她和其他许多人一样，相信假如你把同一件事情反复说上许多次，最后假的也会变成
真的了。
突然，传来一声尖尖的干咳声，他们都转头四下张望。
这声音来自一个高大的，模样傲慢的火箭，它被绑在一根长木杆的顶端。它在发表言论
之前，总要先咳上几声，好引起人们的注意。
“啊咳！啊咳！”他咳嗽着。大家都认真地听着，只有可怜的转轮烟火仍旧摇着头，喃
喃地说，“浪漫已经消亡了。”
“肃静！肃静！”一只爆竹大声嚷道。他是个政客似的人物，在本地的选举中总能独占
鳌头，因此他深知如何使用恰当的政治术语。
“死光了，”转轮烟火低声耳语道，说完她就去睡觉了。
等到周围完全安静下来时，火箭发出第三次咳嗽声，并开始了发言。他的语调既缓慢又
清晰，好像是在背诵自己的记录本一样，对他的听众他从来不正眼去看。说实在的，他的风
度是非常出众的。
“国王的儿子真是幸运啊，”他说道，“他结婚的日子正好是我要升天燃放的时候。真
是的，就算是事先安排好的，对他来说也没有比这更好的了；但话又说回来，王子们总是交
好运的。”
“我的妈呀！”小爆竹说，“我的想法却正好相反，我想我们是为了王子的荣誉而升天
燃放的。”
“对于你来说可能是这样的，”他回答说，“事实上这一点是肯定无疑的。不过对我而
言事情就不一祥了。我是一枚非常神奇的火箭，出身于一个了不起的家庭。我母亲是她那个
时代最出名的转轮烟火，并以她优美的舞姿而著称。只要她一出场亮相，她要旋转十九次才
会飞出去，每转上一次，她就会向空中抛撒七颗粉红的彩星。她的直径有三英尺半，是用最
好的火药制成的。我的父亲像我一样也是火箭，他来自法兰西。他飞得可真高，人们都担心
他不会下来了。尽管如此，他还是下来了，因为他性格善良。他化作一阵金色的雨，非常耀
眼地落了下来。报纸用足吹棒的词句描述他的表演。的确，宫廷的报纸把他称为烟花艺术的
一个伟大成就。”
“烟花，烟花，你是指它吗，”一枚孟加拉烟火说，“我知道它是烟花，因为我看见我
的匣子上写着呢。”
“噢，我说的是火炮，”火箭语调严肃地回答说。孟加拉烟火感到自己受到极大的欺
压，并立即去欺负那些小爆竹了，目的是为了表明自己依旧是个重要的角色。
“我是说，”火箭继续说，“我是说——我说的是什么？”
“你在说你自己，”罗马烛光弹回答说。
“的确，我知道我正在讨论某个有趣的话题，却被人给粗暴地打断了。我讨厌各种粗鲁
的举止和不良行为，因为我是个非常敏感的人。全世界没有哪个人比我更敏感了，对此我深
信不疑。”
“一个敏感的人是指什么？”爆竹对罗马烛光弹问道。
“一个人因为自己脚上生鸡眼，便总想着踩别人的脚趾头，”罗马烛光弹低声耳语道。
爆竹差一点没笑破肚皮。
“请问你笑什么呀？”火箭开口问道，“我就一点没有笑。”
“我笑是因为我高兴，”爆竹回答说。
“这理由太自私了，”火箭脸带怒色地说，“你有什么权利高兴？你应该为别人想想。
实际上，你应该为我想想。我总是想着我自己，我也希望别人都会这么做。这就是所谓的同
情。这是个可爱的美德，我这方面的德性就很高。例如，假定今天夜里我出了什么事，那么
对每一个人来说会是多么的不幸！王子和公主再也不会开心了，他们的婚后生活将会被毁
掉；至于国王，他或许经不住这场打击。真的，我一想起自己所处的重要地位，我几乎感动
得流下眼泪。”
“如果你想给别人带来快乐，”罗马烛光弹说，“那么你最好先不要把自己弄得湿乎乎
的。”
“当然了，”孟加拉烟火说，他现在的精神好多了，“这是个简单的常识。”
“常识，一点不假！”火箭愤愤不平地说，“可你忘了我是很不寻常的，而且非常了不
起。啊，任何人如若没有想象力的话，也会具备常识的。然而我有想象力，因为我从没有把
事物按照它们实际的情况去考虑，我总是把它们想象成另外一回事。至于要我本人不要流
泪，很显然在场的各位没人能够欣赏多情的品性。所幸的是我本人并不介意。能够让我维持
一生的唯一一件事就是想到自己要比别人优越得多，这也是我一贯培养的感觉。你们这些人
都是没有情感的。你们只会傻笑或开玩笑，好像王子和公主不是刚刚结婚似的。”
“啊，正是，”一枚小火球动情地叫道，“难道不行吗？这是一件多大的喜事呀，我只
要一飞到天上去，我就会把这一切都讲给星星听。等我给它们讲起美丽的公主，你会看见星
星们在眨眼睛。”
“啊！多么渺小的人生观！”火箭说，“然而这正是我所预料的。你们胸无大志；你们
既浅薄又无知。噢，或许王子和公主会到有条深深河流的乡村去住；或许他们只有一个儿
子，那个小男孩他王子一样有一头金发和紫色眼晴；或许有一天小男孩会跟保姆一起出去散
步；或许保姆会在一株古老的大树下睡觉；或许小男孩会掉进深深的流水中淹死了。多么可
怕的灾难啊！可怜的人儿，失去了他们唯一的儿子！这真是太可怕了！我永远也忘不了。”
“但是他们并没有失去他们的独子呀，”罗马烛光弹说，“根本就没有任何不幸发主在
他们身上。”
“我从没说过他们会发生不幸，”火箭回答说，“我只是说他们可能会。如果他们已经
失去了独生子，那么再谈此事还有什么意思。我讨厌那些事后反悔的人。不过一想到他们可
能会失去独子，我就会非常难过。”
“你当然会的！”孟加拉烟火大声嚷道，“实际上，你是我所遇到的最感情用事的人。”
“你是我所遇到的最粗俗的人，”火箭反驳说，“你是无法理解我对王子的友情的。”
“噢，你甚至还不认识他呢，”罗马烛光弹怒吼道。
“我从未说过我认识他，”火箭回答说，“我敢说，如果我认识他，我是不会成为他的
朋友的。认识好多朋友，是件非常危险的事。”
“说真的你最好还是不要流眼泪，”火球说，“这可是件要紧的事。”
“我敢肯定，对你是非常要紧，”火箭回答说，“可我想哭就得哭。”说先他还真的哭
了起来，后水像雨点一样从杆子上流下来，差一点淹死两只正在寻找一块干燥的好地方做窝
的小甲虫。
“他必定有真正的浪漫品质，”转轮烟花说，“根本就没有什么可哭的，他却能哭得起
来。”接着她长叹一日气，又想起了那个杉木箱子。
不过罗马烛光弹和孟加拉烟火却是老大不乐意，他们不停地说着：“胡扯！胡扯！”那
声音可真够大的。他们是非常讲实际的，只要是他们反对的东西，他们就会说是胡扯。
这时明月像一面银色的盾牌冉冉升起；繁星开始闪烁，音乐声从宫中传来。
王子和公主正在领舞。他们跳得可真美，就连那些亭亭玉立的白莲花也透过窗户偷看他
俩，大朵的红色罂粟花频频点头，并打着节拍。
随后十点的钟声敲响了，接着十一点的钟声敲响了，然后是十二点。当午夜最后一下钟
声敲响时，所有的人都来到了露天阳台上，国王派人去叫皇家烟花手。
“开始放烟花吧，”国王宣布说。皇家烟花手深深地鞠了一躬，并迈步向下走到花园的
尽头。他带了六个助手，每个助手都本着一根竿子，竿子的顶头捆着一个点燃的火把。
这的确是一场空前盛大的表演。
飕飕！飕飕！转轮烟花飞了上去，一边飞一边旋转着。轰隆！轰隆！罗马烛光弹又飞了
上去。然后爆竹们便到处狂舞起来，接着孟加拉烟火把一切都映成了红彤彤的。“再见
了，”火球喊了一声就腾空而去，抛下无数蓝色的小火星。啪啪！啦啦！大爆竹们也跟着响
了，他们真是痛快无比。他们个个都非常成功，只剩下神奇的火箭了。他浑身哭得湿乎乎
的，根本就无法升空上天。他身上最好的东西只有火药，火药被泪水打湿后，就什么用场也
派不上了。他的那些穷亲戚们，平时他从未打过招呼，只是偶尔讥讽一下，此刻个个都像盛
开着的燃烧的全色花朵，飞到天空中去了。好哇！好哇！宫廷的人们都欢呼起来；小公主高
兴地笑了起来。
“我猜想他们留着我是为了某个更盛大的庆典时用，”火箭说，“毫无疑问就是这个意
思。”他看上去比以前还要傲慢。
第二天工人们来打归清理。“这些人一看就是代表团的，”火箭说，“我要带着尊严来
迎接他们。”于是他就摆出一幅威严的样子，庄重地皱着眉头，仿佛在思考什么雪要的问题
似的。可是他们一点也没有理睬他，直到要离开的时候，他们中的一人碰巧看见了他。
“嘿！”他大喊了一声，“这么破旧的一枚火箭！”说完他便把火箭丢到墙外的阴沟里去了。
“破旧火箭？破旧火箭？”他在空中一边翻滚着一边说，“不可能！大火箭，那个人就
是这么说的。破旧和大这两个发音是非常接近的，的确它们常常是一样的发音。”接着他就
掉进了阴沟里。
“这里并不舒服，”他说，“可没准是个时髦的浴场，他们送我来是为了要我恢复健
康。我的神经的确受到极大的伤害，我也需要休息了。”
这时一只小青蛙朝他游了过来，他有一双明亮闪光的宝石眼睛，和一件绿色斑纹的外衣。
“看来，是个新到的！”青蛙说，“啊，毕竟跟稀泥巴不一样。我只要能享受雨天和一
条阴沟，我便会十分幸福。你认为下午会下雨吗？我真希望如此，可你看这蓝蓝的天空，万
里无云，多么可惜啊！”
“啊咳！啊咳！”火箭说着便咳了起来。
“你的声音多好听啊！”青蛙大声叫道．“真像是青蛙的呱呱叫声，这种呱呱声当然是
世界上最美好的音乐了。今天晚上你可以来听听我们合唱队的演出。我们都在农夫房屋旁的
老鸭池中，月亮一升起我们便开始表演。那可太迷人了，人人都睁着双眼躺着听我们唱。其
实，就在昨天我还听农夫的妻子对她的母亲说，就是因为我们的存在，使她整夜一点儿也睡
不着。能受到这么多人的欢迎，真是谢天谢地。”
“啊咳！啊咳！”火箭生气地说。由于连一句话也插不进去，他感到非常恼火。
“当然了，美妙的音乐，”青蛙继续说，“我希望你能到鸭池来。我要去看我的女儿们
了。我有六个漂亮的女儿，我很担心梭鱼会遇到她们。他是个地道的怪物，会毫不犹豫地拿
她们当早餐吃掉的。好了，再见，我们的谈话真让我开心，我信得过你。”
“谈话，一点不假！”火箭说，“都是你一个人在说话，那不算谈话。”
“总得要人听啊，”青蛙回答说，“我也喜欢一个人谈话。这节省时间，且避免争吵。”
“可我却喜欢争吵，”火箭说。
“我不希望这样，”青蛙得意地说，“争吵太粗俗了，因为在好的社会中，人人都会持
有完全一致的意见。再一次告别了，我看见我的女儿在那边。”说完小青蛙就游走了。
“你是个非常讨厌的家伙，”火箭说，“且教养又很差。我讨厌人们只顾谈论自己，就
跟你这样，要知道此时别人也想说说话，就像我这样。这就是我所说的自私，自私是十分可
恶的事，特别是对于我这种品性的人来说，因为我是以同情心而出了名的。说实在的，你应
该以我为学习榜样，你或许找不到比我更好的榜样了。既然你还有机会，你最好把握住，因
为我差不多马上就要返回宫中去了。我在宫中是个大宠儿；其实，王子和公主在昨天就为庆
祝我而举办了婚礼。当然，这些事你是一无所知的，因为你是个乡巴佬。”
“跟他讲话没有任何益处，”一只蜻蜓开口说，他此刻正坐在一株棕色的香蒲顶上。
“没有任何益处，因为他已经走开了。”
“嗯，那是他的损失，不是我的，”火箭回答说。“我不会仅仅因为他不理会我，就停
止对他说话。我喜欢听自己讲话，这是我最大的乐趣之一。我常常一个人讲上一大堆话，我
可是太聪明了，有时候我连我自己讲的话也不懂。”
“那么你真应该去讲授哲学，”晴蜓说，说完他展开自己一对可爱的纱翼朝空中飞去了。
“他不留在这儿可算是傻极了！”火箭说，“我敢说他并不是经常有这样的机会来提高
智力的。然而，我一点也不介意。像我这样的天才肯定有一天会得人赏识的。”他往稀泥中
陷得更深了。
过了一会儿一只白色的大鸭子向他游了过来。她有一对黄色的腿和一双蹼足，而且由于
她走起路来一摇一摆的，便被视为是个大美人。
“嘎，嘎，嘎，”她叫着说，“你的样子多么古怪啊！我可以问问你是怎么生得如此模
样的吗？或者是由于一次事故造成的？”
“很显然，你一直都住在乡下，”火箭回答说，“不然你会知道我是谁的。不过，我会
原谅你的无知。期望别人跟自己一样了不起是不公平的。等你听说我能够飞上天空并撒下一
阵金色的雨点后，你一定会感到惊讶的。”
“我倒不看重那个，”鸭子说，“因为我看不出它对别人会有什么好处。眼下，要是你
能像牛一样地去犁地，像马一样地去拉车，或像牧羊犬那样地照看羊群，那还算是个人物。”
“我的好人啊，”火箭用十分高傲的语言大声说道，“可见你是属于下等阶层的。我这
样身份的人是永远不会有用的。我们已经有了一定的成就，那就足够了。我本人对各种所谓
的勤劳并没有好感，尤其对像你赞赏的那些勤劳更是一点好感也没有。说实话，我一贯认为
做艰苦的工作仅仅是那些无事可干的人们的一种逃避方式。”
“好吧，好吧，”鸭子说，她是个处事平稳的人，也从未跟任何人争吵过，“各人有各
人的爱好。我想，无论如何，你要在这儿安家落户了吧。”
“啊！当然不会了，”火箭嚷道，“我只是个过路人，一位有名望的客人。事实是我觉
得这地方好无聊。这儿既不宁静，又没有社交生活。说实在的，这儿根本就是郊外。我可能
要回到宫里去，因为我注定了要在世界上做一番成就的。”
“我也曾想过要投身于公众事业中去，”鸭子说，“世上有那么多需要革新的事物。老
实说，我前些时干过一阵会议的主席工作，我们通过决议谴责一切我们不喜欢的东西。然
而，它们好像并没有多大效果。现在我一心从事家务，照看我的家庭。”
“我生来就是为了这个社会的，”火箭说，“我所有的亲戚也都是如此，甚至包括他们
中最卑微的。只要我们一出场，随时都会引起广泛的关注。其实还没轮到我出场呢，不过只
要我一出现，准会是壮观的场面。说到家务事，它会使人早早地衰老，并无心追求更高的目
标。”
“啊！更高的生活目标，它们该有多好呀！”鸭子说，“可它倒使我觉得好饥饿。”说
完她就朝下游泅水而去，同时还“嘎，嘎，嘎”地叫着。
“回来，快回来！”火箭尖声明着，“我有好多话要对你说。”但是鸭子没理会他。
“我很高兴她离去了，”他对自己说，“她的思想的确只算得上一般。”他往稀泥中陷得更
深了，这时才开始想起天才的寂寞来。忽然有两个小男孩身穿白色的粗布衫，手拿一只水
壶，怀里抱着好些柴火，朝岸边跑了过来。
“这一定是那个代表团了，”火箭说着，又努力表现出非常庄重的样子。
“嘿！”其中的一个孩子叫道，“快看这根旧木棍！我不知道它怎么会在这儿。”他把
火箭从阴沟里拾起。
“旧木棍！”火箭说，“不可能！金木棍，这才是他说的。金木棍才是很中听的话。实
际上，他把我错当成宫中的某位显贵了。”
“我们把它放到火里去吧！”另一个孩子说，“它会帮着把水烧开。”
于是他俩把柴火堆在一起，把火箭放在最上面，并点燃了火。
“这下可太棒了，”火箭大声叫道，“他们要在大白天里把我给燃放了，这样人人都会
看见我了。”
“我们现在去睡觉吧，”他俩说，“睡醒时水壶的水就会烧开了。”说完他们便在草地
上躺下身，闭上了眼睛。
火箭浑身都湿透了，所以花了好长时间才把他烤干。不过，到最后火苗还是把他点燃了。
“现在我就要升空了！”他大叫起来，同时把身体挺得笔直笔直的。“我知道我要飞得
比星星更高，比月亮更高，比太阳更高。其实，我会飞得高到——”
嘶嘶！嘶嘶！嘶嘶！他垂直朝天空中飞去。
“太棒了！”他叫了起来，“我要这样一直飞下去，我是多么的成功啊！”
不过，没有人看见他。
这时他开始感到有一股奇怪的刺痛袭遍全身。
“现在我就要爆炸了，”他大声喊道，“我要点燃整个世界，我要声威大震，让所有的
人在这一年里都不再谈论别的事情。”的确他真的爆炸了。呼！呼：呼！火药爆炸了。这是
千真万确的。
可是没有人听见他，就连那两个小孩也没有听见，因为他俩睡得可熟了。
接着他所剩下的只有木棍了，木棍掉下去，正好落在一只在阴沟边散步的鹅的背上。
“天呀！”鹅叫了起来，“怎么下起棍子来了。”说完就跳进河里去了。
“我知道我会创造奇迹的，”火箭喘息着说，然后他就熄灭了。
the remarkable rocket
the kings son was going to be married, so there were general
rejoicings.  he had waited a whole year for his bride, and at last
she had arrived.  she was a russian princess, and had driven all
the way from finland in a sledge drawn by six reindeer.  the sledge
was shaped like a great golden swan, and between the swans wings
lay the little princess herself.  her long ermine-cloak reached
right down to her feet, on her head was a tiny cap of silver
tissue, and she was as pale as the snow palace in which she had
always lived.  so pale was she that as she drove through the
streets all the people wondered.  "she is like a white rose!" they
cried, and they threw down flowers on her from the balconies.
at the gate of the castle the prince was waiting to receive her.
he had dreamy violet eyes, and his hair was like fine gold.  when
he saw her he sank upon one knee, and kissed her hand.
"your picture was beautiful," he murmured, "but you are more
beautiful than your picture"; and the little princess blushed.
"she was like a white rose before," said a young page to his
neighbour, "but she is like a red rose now"; and the whole court
was delighted.
for the next three days everybody went about saying, "white rose,
red rose, red rose, white rose"; and the king gave orders that the
pages salary was to be doubled.  as he received no salary at all
this was not of much use to him, but it was considered a great
honour, and was duly published in the court gazette.
when the three days were over the marriage was celebrated.  it was
a magnificent ceremony, and the bride and bridegroom walked hand in
hand under a canopy of purple velvet embroidered with little
pearls.  then there was a state banquet, which lasted for five
hours.  the prince and princess sat at the top of the great hall
and drank out of a cup of clear crystal.  only true lovers could
drink out of this cup, for if false lips touched it, it grew grey
and dull and cloudy.
"its quite clear that they love each other," said the little page,
"as clear as crystal!" and the king doubled his salary a second
time.  "what an honour!" cried all the courtiers.
after the banquet there was to be a ball.  the bride and bridegroom
were to dance the rose-dance together, and the king had promised to
play the flute.  he played very badly, but no one had ever dared to
tell him so, because he was the king.  indeed, he knew only two
airs, and was never quite certain which one he was playing; but it
made no matter, for, whatever he did, everybody cried out,
"charming! charming!"
the last item on the programme was a grand display of fireworks, to
be let off exactly at midnight.  the little princess had never seen
a firework in her life, so the king had given orders that the royal
pyrotechnist should be in attendance on the day of her marriage.
"what are fireworks like?" she had asked the prince, one morning,
as she was walking on the terrace.
"they are like the aurora borealis," said the king, who always
answered questions that were addressed to other people, "only much
more natural.  i prefer them to stars myself, as you always know
when they are going to appear, and they are as delightful as my own
flute-playing.  you must certainly see them."
so at the end of the kings garden a great stand had been set up,
and as soon as the royal pyrotechnist had put everything in its
proper place, the fireworks began to talk to each other.
"the world is certainly very beautiful," cried a little squib.
"just look at those yellow tulips.  why! if they were real crackers
they could not be lovelier.  i am very glad i have travelled.
travel improves the mind wonderfully, and does away with all ones
prejudices."
"the kings garden is not the world, you foolish squib," said a big
roman candle; "the world is an enormous place, and it would take
you three days to see it thoroughly."
"any place you love is the world to you," exclaimed a pensive
catherine wheel, who had been attached to an old deal box in early
life, and prided herself on her broken heart; "but love is not
fashionable any more, the poets have killed it.  they wrote so much
about it that nobody believed them, and i am not surprised.  true
love suffers, and is silent.  i remember myself once -  but it is
no matter now.  romance is a thing of the past."
"nonsense!" said the roman candle, "romance never dies.  it is like
the moon, and lives for ever.  the bride and bridegroom, for
instance, love each other very dearly.  i heard all about them this
morning from a brown-paper cartridge, who happened to be staying in
the same drawer as myself, and knew the latest court news."
but the catherine wheel shook her head.  "romance is dead, romance
is dead, romance is dead," she murmured.  she was one of those
people who think that, if you say the same thing over and over a
great many times, it becomes true in the end.
suddenly, a sharp, dry cough was heard, and they all looked round.
it came from a tall, supercilious-looking rocket, who was tied to
the end of a long stick.  he always coughed before he made any
observation, so as to attract attention.
"ahem! ahem!" he said, and everybody listened except the poor
catherine wheel, who was still shaking her head, and murmuring,
"romance is dead."
"order! order!" cried out a cracker.  he was something of a
politician, and had always taken a prominent part in the local
elections, so he knew the proper parliamentary expressions to use.
"quite dead," whispered the catherine wheel, and she went off to
sleep.
as soon as there was perfect silence, the rocket coughed a third
time and began.  he spoke with a very slow, distinct voice, as if
he was dictating his memoirs, and always looked over the shoulder
of the person to whom he was talking.  in fact, he had a most
distinguished manner.
"how fortunate it is for the kings son," he remarked, "that he is
to be married on the very day on which i am to be let off.  really,
if it had been arranged beforehand, it could not have turned out
better for him; but, princes are always lucky."
"dear me!" said the little squib, "i thought it was quite the other
way, and that we were to be let off in the princes honour."
"it may be so with you," he answered; "indeed, i have no doubt that
it is, but with me it is different.  i am a very remarkable rocket,
and come of remarkable parents.  my mother was the most celebrated
catherine wheel of her day, and was renowned for her graceful
dancing.  when she made her great public appearance she spun round
nineteen times before she went out, and each time that she did so
she threw into the air seven pink stars.  she was three feet and a
half in diameter, and made of the very best gunpowder.  my father
was a rocket like myself, and of french extraction.  he flew so
high that the people were afraid that he would never come down
again.  he did, though, for he was of a kindly disposition, and he
made a most brilliant descent in a shower of golden rain.  the
newspapers wrote about his performance in very flattering terms.
indeed, the court gazette called him a triumph of pylotechnic art."
"pyrotechnic, pyrotechnic, you mean," said a bengal light; "i know
it is pyrotechnic, for i saw it written on my own canister."
"well, i said pylotechnic," answered the rocket, in a severe tone
of voice, and the bengal light felt so crushed that he began at
once to bully the little squibs, in order to show that he was still
a person of some importance.
"i was saying," continued the rocket, "i was saying - what was i
saying?"
"you were talking about yourself," replied the roman candle.
"of course; i knew i was discussing some interesting subject when i
was so rudely interrupted.  i hate rudeness and bad manners of
every kind, for i am extremely sensitive.  no one in the whole
world is so sensitive as i am, i am quite sure of that."
"what is a sensitive person?" said the cracker to the roman candle.
"a person who, because he has corns himself, always treads on other
peoples toes," answered the roman candle in a low whisper; and the
cracker nearly exploded with laughter.
"pray, what are you laughing at?" inquired the rocket; "i am not
laughing."
"i am laughing because i am happy," replied the cracker.
"that is a very selfish reason," said the rocket angrily.  "what
right have you to be happy?  you should be thinking about others.
in fact, you should be thinking about me.  i am always thinking
about myself, and i expect everybody else to do the same.  that is
what is called sympathy.  it is a beautiful virtue, and i possess
it in a high degree.  suppose, for instance, anything happened to
me to-night, what a misfortune that would be for every one!  the
prince and princess would never be happy again, their whole married
life would be spoiled; and as for the king, i know he would not get
over it.  really, when i begin to reflect on the importance of my
position, i am almost moved to tears."
"if you want to give pleasure to others," cried the roman candle,
"you had better keep yourself dry."
"certainly," exclaimed the bengal light, who was now in better
spirits; "that is only common sense."
"common sense, indeed!" said the rocket indignantly; "you forget
that i am very uncommon, and very remarkable.  why, anybody can
have common sense, provided that they have no imagination.  but i
have imagination, for i never think of things as they really are; i
always think of them as being quite different.  as for keeping
myself dry, there is evidently no one here who can at all
appreciate an emotional nature.  fortunately for myself, i dont
care.  the only thing that sustains one through life is the
consciousness of the immense inferiority of everybody else, and
this is a feeling that i have always cultivated.  but none of you
have any hearts.  here you are laughing and making merry just as if
the prince and princess had not just been married."
"well, really," exclaimed a small fire-balloon, "why not?  it is a
most joyful occasion, and when i soar up into the air i intend to
tell the stars all about it.  you will see them twinkle when i talk
to them about the pretty bride."
"ah! what a trivial view of life!" said the rocket; "but it is only
what i expected.  there is nothing in you; you are hollow and
empty.  why, perhaps the prince and princess may go to live in a
country where there is a deep river, and perhaps they may have one
only son, a little fair-haired boy with violet eyes like the prince
himself; and perhaps some day he may go out to walk with his nurse;
and perhaps the nurse may go to sleep under a great elder-tree; and
perhaps the little boy may fall into the deep river and be drowned.
what a terrible misfortune!  poor people, to lose their only son!
it is really too dreadful!  i shall never get over it."
"but they have not lost their only son," said the roman candle; "no
misfortune has happened to them at all."
"i never said that they had," replied the rocket; "i said that they
might.  if they had lost their only son there would be no use in
saying anything more about the matter.  i hate people who cry over
spilt milk.  but when i think that they might lose their only son,
i certainly am very much affected."
"you certainly are!" cried the bengal light.  "in fact, you are the
most affected person i ever met."
"you are the rudest person i ever met," said the rocket, "and you
cannot understand my friendship for the prince."
"why, you dont even know him," growled the roman candle.
"i never said i knew him," answered the rocket.  "i dare say that
if i knew him i should not be his friend at all.  it is a very
dangerous thing to know ones friends."
"you had really better keep yourself dry," said the fire-balloon.
"that is the important thing."
"very important for you, i have no doubt," answered the rocket,
"but i shall weep if i choose"; and he actually burst into real
tears, which flowed down his stick like rain-drops, and nearly
drowned two little beetles, who were just thinking of setting up
house together, and were looking for a nice dry spot to live in.
"he must have a truly romantic nature," said the catherine wheel,
"for he weeps when there is nothing at all to weep about"; and she
heaved a deep sigh, and thought about the deal box.
but the roman candle and the bengal light were quite indignant, and
kept saying, "humbug! humbug!" at the top of their voices.  they
were extremely practical, and whenever they objected to anything
they called it humbug.
then the moon rose like a wonderful silver shield; and the stars
began to shine, and a sound of music came from the palace.
the prince and princess were leading the dance.  they danced so
beautifully that the tall white lilies peeped in at the window and
watched them, and the great red poppies nodded their heads and beat
time.
then ten oclock struck, and then eleven, and then twelve, and at
the last stroke of midnight every one came out on the terrace, and
the king sent for the royal pyrotechnist.
"let the fireworks begin," said the king; and the royal
pyrotechnist made a low bow, and marched down to the end of the
garden.  he had six attendants with him, each of whom carried a
lighted torch at the end of a long pole.
it was certainly a magnificent display.
whizz! whizz! went the catherine wheel, as she spun round and
round.  boom!  boom! went the roman candle.  then the squibs danced
all over the place, and the bengal lights made everything look
scarlet.  "good-bye," cried the fire-balloon, as he soared away,
dropping tiny blue sparks.  bang! bang! answered the crackers, who
were enjoying themselves immensely.  every one was a great success
except the remarkable rocket.  he was so damp with crying that he
could not go off at all.  the best thing in him was the gunpowder,
and that was so wet with tears that it was of no use.  all his poor
relations, to whom he would never speak, except with a sneer, shot
up into the sky like wonderful golden flowers with blossoms of
fire.  huzza! huzza! cried the court; and the little princess
laughed with pleasure.
"i suppose they are reserving me for some grand occasion," said the
rocket; "no doubt that is what it means," and he looked more
supercilious than ever.
the next day the workmen came to put everything tidy.  "this is
evidently a deputation," said the rocket; "i will receive them with
becoming dignity" so he put his nose in the air, and began to frown
severely as if he were thinking about some very important subject.
but they took no notice of him at all till they were just going
away.  then one of them caught sight of him.  "hallo!" he cried,
"what a bad rocket!" and he threw him over the wall into the ditch.
"bad rocket?  bad rocket?" he said, as he whirled through the air;
"impossible!  grand rocket, that is what the man said.  bad and
grand sound very much the same, indeed they often are the same";
and he fell into the mud.
"it is not comfortable here," he remarked, "but no doubt it is some
fashionable watering-place, and they have sent me away to recruit
my health.  my nerves are certainly very much shattered, and i
require rest."
then a little frog, with bright jewelled eyes, and a green mottled
coat, swam up to him.
"a new arrival, i see!" said the frog.  "well, after all there is
nothing like mud.  give me rainy weather and a ditch, and i am
quite happy.  do you think it will be a wet afternoon?  i am sure i
hope so, but the sky is quite blue and cloudless.  what a pity!"
"ahem! ahem!" said the rocket, and he began to cough.
"what a delightful voice you have!" cried the frog.  "really it is
quite like a croak, and croaking is of course the most musical
sound in the world.  you will hear our glee-club this evening.  we
sit in the old duck pond close by the farmers house, and as soon
as the moon rises we begin.  it is so entrancing that everybody
lies awake to listen to us.  in fact, it was only yesterday that i
heard the farmers wife say to her mother that she could not get a
wink of sleep at night on account of us.  it is most gratifying to
find oneself so popular."
"ahem! ahem!" said the rocket angrily.  he was very much annoyed
that he could not get a word in.
"a delightful voice, certainly," continued the frog; "i hope you
will come over to the duck-pond.  i am off to look for my
daughters.  i have six beautiful daughters, and i am so afraid the
pike may meet them.  he is a perfect monster, and would have no
hesitation in breakfasting off them.  well, good-bye:  i have
enjoyed our conversation very much, i assure you."
"conversation, indeed!" said the rocket.  "you have talked the
whole time yourself.  that is not conversation."
"somebody must listen," answered the frog, "and i like to do all
the talking myself.  it saves time, and prevents arguments."
"but i like arguments," said the rocket.
"i hope not," said the frog complacently.  "arguments are extremely
vulgar, for everybody in good society holds exactly the same
opinions.  good-bye a second time; i see my daughters in the
distance and the little frog swam away.
"you are a very irritating person," said the rocket, "and very ill-
bred.  i hate people who talk about themselves, as you do, when one
wants to talk about oneself, as i do.  it is what i call
selfishness, and selfishness is a most detestable thing, especially
to any one of my temperament, for i am well known for my
sympathetic nature.  in fact, you should take example by me; you
could not possibly have a better model.  now that you have the
chance you had better avail yourself of it, for i am going back to
court almost immediately.  i am a great favourite at court; in
fact, the prince and princess were married yesterday in my honour.
of course you know nothing of these matters, for you are a
provincial."
"there is no good talking to him," said a dragon-fly, who was
sitting on the top of a large brown bulrush; "no good at all, for
he has gone away."
"well, that is his loss, not mine," answered the rocket.  "i am not
going to stop talking to him merely because he pays no attention.
i like hearing myself talk.  it is one of my greatest pleasures.  i
often have long conversations all by myself, and i am so clever
that sometimes i dont understand a single word of what i am
saying."
"then you should certainly lecture on philosophy," said the dragon-
fly; and he spread a pair of lovely gauze wings and soared away
into the sky.
"how very silly of him not to stay here!" said the rocket.  "i am
sure that he has not often got such a chance of improving his mind.
however, i dont care a bit.  genius like mine is sure to be
appreciated some day"; and he sank down a little deeper into the
mud.
after some time a large white duck swam up to him.  she had yellow
legs, and webbed feet, and was considered a great beauty on account
of her waddle.
"quack, quack, quack," she said.  "what a curious shape you are!
may i ask were you born like that, or is it the result of an
accident?"
"it is quite evident that you have always lived in the country,"
answered the rocket, "otherwise you would know who i am.  however,
i excuse your ignorance.  it would be unfair to expect other people
to be as remarkable as oneself.  you will no doubt be surprised to
hear that i can fly up into the sky, and come down in a shower of
golden rain."
"i dont think much of that," said the duck, "as i cannot see what
use it is to any one.  now, if you could plough the fields like the
ox, or draw a cart like the horse, or look after the sheep like the
collie-dog, that would be something."
"my good creature," cried the rocket in a very haughty tone of
voice, "i see that you belong to the lower orders.  a person of my
position is never useful.  we have certain accomplishments, and
that is more than sufficient.  i have no sympathy myself with
industry of any kind, least of all with such industries as you seem
to recommend.  indeed, i have always been of opinion that hard work
is simply the refuge of people who have nothing whatever to do."
"well, well," said the duck, who was of a very peaceable
disposition, and never quarrelled with any one, "everybody has
different tastes.  i hope, at any rate, that you are going to take
up your residence here."
"oh! dear no," cried the rocket.  "i am merely a visitor, a
distinguished visitor.  the fact is that i find this place rather
tedious.  there is neither society here, nor solitude.  in fact, it
is essentially suburban.  i shall probably go back to court, for i
know that i am destined to make a sensation in the world."
"i had thoughts of entering public life once myself," remarked the
duck; "there are so many things that need reforming.  indeed, i
took the chair at a meeting some time ago, and we passed
resolutions condemning everything that we did not like.  however,
they did not seem to have much effect.  now i go in for
domesticity, and look after my family."
"i am made for public life," said the rocket, "and so are all my
relations, even the humblest of them.  whenever we appear we excite
great attention.  i have not actually appeared myself, but when i
do so it will be a magnificent sight.  as for domesticity, it ages
one rapidly, and distracts ones mind from higher things."
"ah! the higher things of life, how fine they are!" said the duck;
"and that reminds me how hungry i feel":  and she swam away down
the stream, saying, "quack, quack, quack."
"come back! come back!" screamed the rocket, "i have a great deal
to say to you"; but the duck paid no attention to him.  "i am glad
that she has gone," he said to himself, "she has a decidedly
middle-class mind"; and he sank a little deeper still into the mud,
and began to think about the loneliness of genius, when suddenly
two little boys in white smocks came running down the bank, with a
kettle and some faggots.
"this must be the deputation," said the rocket, and he tried to
look very dignified.
"hallo!" cried one of the boys, "look at this old stick!  i wonder
how it came here"; and he picked the rocket out of the ditch.
"old stick!" said the rocket, "impossible!  gold stick, that is
what he said.  gold stick is very complimentary.  in fact, he
mistakes me for one of the court dignitaries!"
"let us put it into the fire!" said the other boy, "it will help to
boil the kettle."
so they piled the faggots together, and put the rocket on top, and
lit the fire.
"this is magnificent," cried the rocket, "they are going to let me
off in broad day-light, so that every one can see me."
"we will go to sleep now," they said, "and when we wake up the
kettle will be boiled"; and they lay down on the grass, and shut
their eyes.
the rocket was very damp, so he took a long time to burn.  at last,
however, the fire caught him.
"now i am going off!" he cried, and he made himself very stiff and
straight.  "i know i shall go much higher than the stars, much
higher than the moon, much higher than the sun.  in fact, i shall
go so high that - "
fizz! fizz! fizz! and he went straight up into the air.
"delightful!" he cried, "i shall go on like this for ever.  what a
success i am!"
but nobody saw him.
then he began to feel a curious tingling sensation all over him.
"now i am going to explode," he cried.  "i shall set the whole
world on fire, and make such a noise that nobody will talk about
anything else for a whole year."  and he certainly did explode.
bang! bang! bang! went the gunpowder.  there was no doubt about it.
but nobody heard him, not even the two little boys, for they were
sound asleep.
then all that was left of him was the stick, and this fell down on
the back of a goose who was taking a walk by the side of the ditch.
"good heavens!" cried the goose.  "it is going to rain sticks"; and
she rushed into the water.
"i knew i should create a great sensation," gasped the rocket, and
he went out.
