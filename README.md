## HOW TO USE MY SITE TO DOWNLOAD ANSWERS FROM CHEGG.COM FOR FREE
It's in my private repo, and for study use only!! So I won't open the source code!!

# INTERESTING STORY OF THIS PROJECT
Since I developed this project on my own and open its code on github two years ago, a Chinese online shop stole my code and make this project profitable (around 20k USD per month). They even sent me and my parents a threaten letter (about my safety) to force me to close my site and cooperate with them!! So I closed my site(www.chegghero.com), the previous repo, and github account!! Now I open it again because of the career fair!! I hope that this repo can demonstrate some part of my skills!
