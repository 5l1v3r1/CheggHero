paste the link to the file you want to download on coursehero.com && paste your email && paste your activation code bought on a third party website (link provided below) ! (Only 2 RMB / 10 cents). I charge this amount only to protect my site from attack! Again, non-profitable project, only for study use!!!

### step 2

## HOW TO USE MY SITE TO DOWNLOAD ANSWERS FROM CHEGG.COM FOR FREE
It's in my private repo, and for study use only!! So I won't open the source code!!

## FILES' FUNTIONS
### Folder "chegghero"
The folder "chegghero" is the server-side folder, which provides .py files for the server to unlock, download, and send files. Based on selenium and autoIT, I fullfilled these easily!
Also, it will check that if the "code" entered by user is valid. I didn't use sql or database to manage the codes, but used a txt file and a python file!
### Folder "course_hero_auto_reg"
The folder "course_hero_auto_reg" contains some c++ program that could be run locally or on the server. The main purpose of these files is to massively register coursehero accounts, generate random files from a library, and upload those files generated to COURSEHERO.com in order to get free unlock chances! Also, generate the activation code by different seed and upload the activation code to the server and the third-party website!
### More details?
Due to there's an ACM regional competition try-out in UT on 21th SEPT. I won't have much time to describe this project! Sorry! But I can explain to you if you want!

# INTERESTING STORY OF THIS PROJECT
Since I developed this project on my own and open its code on github two years ago, a Chinese online shop stole my code and make this project profitable (around 20k USD per month). They even sent me and my parents a threaten letter (about my safety) to force me to close my site and cooperate with them!! So I closed my site(www.chegghero.com), the previous repo, and github account!! Now I open it again because of the career fair!! I hope that this repo can demonstrate some part of my skills!
